## [Unreleased]

> **Status.** Latest shipped: v1.26.4 PATCH (2026-08-19). Composition details in the v1.26.4 entry below. The v1.26.5 PATCH slot was CANCELLED 2026-08-19 — folded into v1.27.0 MINOR to amortize release-cycle overhead. Pending work tracks live in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

## [1.26.4] - 2026-08-19

20 merge commits (74 files, +3786/-1816 LOC, 3290 → 3434 tests). Six-axis fix batch: silent-bug cluster, wire-shape accuracy, lint report UX, extraction prompt bloat, contradiction data-loss, per-step measurement scaffolding.

### Fixed

- **Settings: per-task model fields wiped on every commit (Issue #456, PR #462).** `commitTempSettings` ran a v1.24.1 PATCH Phase 5.5.0 belt-and-suspenders cascade that fired a `commit-time model change` event on every commit, overwriting per-task `modelOverride`/`temperature`/`topP`/`seed`/`enableThinking` on `commitTempSettings`. The 3 direct-write sites that bypass `setFieldValue` (provider change / Bedrock region change / post-test sync) all hit it. Fix removes the cascade entirely; per-task fields are owned by `setFieldValue` and `commitTempSettings` is a pure pass-through. 3 unit + 2 integration regression tests pin the contract. Closes #456.

- **Wrapper: `createMessageStream` dropped every advanced setting (Issue #451, PR #465).** `wrapWithAdvancedSettings` used `Object.create(client)` to inherit `createMessageStream`, which sidestepped the settings-injection seam entirely — temperature / top_p / seed / repetitionPenalty / enableThinking were silently dropped on the Query Wiki streaming path (the only user-facing stream surface). Fix mirrors `createMessageWithOutput`'s wrapping shape: hook the stream method, build sampling args + provider options identically, apply at the seam. 4 wire-body regression tests pin injection reaches the call. Closes #451.

- **LLM semantic dedup: `parseJsonResponse` parse failure read as "no match" (Issue #407 Stage 1, PR #444).** `path-resolution.ts:220` collapsed `{ok: false, reason}` from `parseJsonResult` (the union added in PR #436) into the same `match: false` branch as a legitimate negative answer. Fix routes `{ok: false}` through a new `parse-failure` log + the slug-path fallback (named failure rather than silent answer); the `match: false` branch is reached only when the reply parsed. Counter-test pins the new branch: a well-formed `{match: false}` is not reported as a parse failure. 2996 → 3000 tests. Stage 2 of #407 follows in v1.27.0.

- **Output schemas: extraction wire schema had no top-level `required` array (Issue #463, PR #476).** `SourceAnalysisLLMSchema` carried `.passthrough()` AND marked every top-level field `.optional()`, so the wire `additionalProperties: true` had no `required` to enforce and the model's reply (`source_title_`, `summary=`, phantom `", ": ""`) was formally valid. Drop `.optional()` from `entities` + `concepts` only; `.passthrough()` stays (per the user requirement "针对一些格式内容多变的属性，必须留好冗余空间"). `source_title` / `summary` / `key_points` / `related_pages` / `contradictions` stay `.optional()` because `normalizeBatchResponse` does not consult them for batch validity (only entities + concepts do) and the runtime has explicit fallbacks. The "accepts `{}`" test is inverted: `{}` is now REJECTED (the constraint that was missing); `{entities: [], concepts: []}` is the empty-batch signal. 3320 → 3328 tests. Closes #463.

- **Lint prompt: `fillEmptyPage` hardcoded default tag taxonomy contradicted runtime injection (Issue #459/#460, PR #460 DocTpoint).** The fix line at `src/wiki/prompts/fixes.ts:47` enumerated ≥3 default-taxonomy values, silently breaking disjoint custom vocabularies (biochemistry, legal domain, etc.). Defer to system-layer Active Tag Vocabulary (the same path runtime uses). 68 regression tests pin the runtime vocabulary reaches the lint task + no `FIX_PROMPTS` line enumerates default-taxonomy values. Closes #459/#460.

- **Path resolution: drop the alias latch on ambiguous fallback (Issue #446 follow-on, PR #478).** `path-resolution.ts:174` previously latched an extracted name as a wiki alias whenever a name-collision fallback was taken, polluting the alias index with single-extraction noise. A name claimed by two pages resolved through the latch to whichever one extracted first; re-extraction then hardened the wrong answer. Fix: drop the latch entirely. The ambiguous case now reports "neither" (per #446's lesson) and the typed-list fallback takes over. 3000 → 3004 tests. Closes #446 follow-on.

- **Extraction: freeze the slug catalog per run so the prompt cache survives (Issue #452, PR #483).** The catalog is the first block of `analyzeSource` and ~91% of its characters — the span every prefix cache (Anthropic / OpenAI / llama.cpp KV reuse) would otherwise re-prefill every note. `buildCompactSlugList` re-sorted per call, so pages the previous note created sorted into the middle and the reusable span ended there. Measured on LM Studio (gemma-4-26b-a4b-qat, 2844 slugs, 24.5 K prompt tokens, `max_tokens=1`): **23.5 s prefill/note against 4.39 s** when new slugs are appended instead. Fix: a folder/batch ingest carries a `RunSlugCatalog` on its `BatchRequirementsContext` — sorted snapshot at run start, pages that appear during the run appended in first-seen order so an earlier append never shifts a later one. Single-file ingests pass no catalog and get the freshly sorted list as before. Two consequences, both deliberate: deleted-mid-run pages stay in the catalog until the run ends (dropping them reintroduces mid-list divergence; stale targets resolved downstream by `PageFactory.resolvePagePath`), and re-ingesting a source inside the wiki folder still excludes its own slug per call (one-line shift; sources outside the wiki folder, the normal case, were never in the catalog). This makes the block prefix-stable *within* a run — Direction 1 of #449; Direction 2 (cross-run caching) is the `cacheBreakpoint` wire-up below. Closes #452.

- **AI-SDK migration: reasoning-only guard dropped (Issue #470, PR #488).** The v1.26.0 Batch 6 4-layer force-disable thinking lost Layer 1 (`reasoningEffort: 'none'`) when the AI-SDK v6 client migration reshuffled the buildProviderOptions destructure: `reasoningEffort` was no longer threaded through to the wire on any openai-compat provider. Fix: thread `reasoningEffort` through `buildProviderOptions` for every openai-compat provider that does not have a Zod-declared equivalent, with the reasoning-strip-probe cache unchanged. The 400-strip retry path also accepts `reasoningEffort` so a backend that rejects the field gets a clean retry rather than a second 400. 2 regression tests pin the wire-body assertion (`reasoning_effort: 'none'` IS on the body). Closes #470.

- **Three-layer repair for DeepSeek reasoning-model ingest (Issue #474, PR #486).** Three failure modes collapsed into "Failed to connect to deepseek API". **Layer 1 — prose reasoning pollution:** `prependReasoningForParse` always prepended `reasoning_content` before visible text; when reasoning is prose (deepseek-v4-flash narrative thinking) and visible text is JSON, the parse target became prose + JSON and every `parseJsonResult` layer walked into the prose first. Fix: drop reasoning when it has no `<think>` wrapper AND visible text is non-empty; the Qwen3.5 JSON-in-reasoning case (text='' + reasoning=JSON) is preserved (still prepends); the R1 / o-series `<think>`-wrapped case is preserved (still wraps). **Layer 2 — `NoOutputGeneratedError` misclassification:** AI SDK's step-retry exhaustion path throws `NoOutputGeneratedError` (sibling of `NoObjectGeneratedError`; both extend `AISDKError`); the catch only checked `NoObjectGeneratedError.isInstance(err)`, so the sibling slipped through and `mapAiSdkError` rewrote it as "Failed to connect to deepseek API" — a budget problem misreported as a connectivity error. Fix: catch `NoOutputGeneratedError` in both `createMessage` and `createMessageWithOutput`; return `''` / empty shape so the caller's `parseJsonResponse` empty-input path handles it; `finishReason: 'stop'` is the right semantic. **Layer 3 — output mode reporting honesty:** `OutputModeProber` defaulted to `json_schema` for every provider, but `OpenAICompatSdkClient` is constructed with `supportsStructuredOutputs: false` for 5 cloud openai-compat providers (deepseek / kimi / glm / minimax / openrouter); the SDK encodes `json_object` on the wire regardless, silently dropping caller-supplied schemas. New `getCurrentOutputMode(model)` pre-seeds the cache to `json_object` on the first call when `!supportsStructuredOutputs` — initialization, not demotion. `outputMode` reports the wire shape the SDK actually emits; side benefit is the wasted `json_schema → json_object` demotion cycle on first 400 is skipped (1 HTTP call saved per first failure on these providers). 3328 → 3391 tests. Closes #474.

- **Page-batch-runner test: relax timing assertion slop (PR #489).** A 30 ms timing assertion on the page-batch-runner internals flaked under CI's variable load. Relaxed to 25 ms slop (10/10 runs clean on a 6-vCPU runner). 3391 tests. No behaviour change.

- **CI: Gate 1 PR-time status check (PR #487).** `.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml` runs the full Five-Gate (lint + tsc + build + test + css-lint) on every PR to `main`; status check `Gate 1 / Five-Gate` is now a branch-protection requirement. **Order is non-negotiable: build before test** — `openai-codex-loopback-flow.test.ts:39` reads `main.js` to verify esbuild bundle shape, so a test-before-build run on a fresh clone fails ENOENT. CLAUDE.md §"Gate 1" was corrected to match. Local `pnpm lint` remains `src/`-only (the Obsidian Bot scans the whole repo `.ts` tree, not just `src/`, and `pnpm lint:tools-bot` is the local pre-check). Lockfile-pinned install (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`) prevents `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` drift between local Gate 1 and CI. CI is defense-in-depth; this fork's current agent-owned review and integration policy lives in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.

- **Final lint analysis sent an uncapped full-wiki context, 400-ing on 49K-context local models (Issue #473, PR #494).** `runAnalysisPhase` (`src/wiki/lint/llm-phases/analysis-phase.ts`) read the entire `wiki/index.md` and injected it into the LLM prompt. On a 1,690-page vault that is ~152K input tokens against an LM Studio 49K context window → HTTP 400. Decision (established with the maintainer from Karpathy first principles): instead of capping the prompt or adding a token-budget estimator, **remove the LLM analysis section entirely**. The prompt asks the LLM to judge a whole wiki it only sees 8 pages of; schema-suggest keeps the LLM-advice path on the "Analyze Schema" button. This deletes the section, its 5 accumulated regressions (duplicate `## LLM 分析` heading — root cause: `report-builder.ts`'s `cleanedLLM.startsWith('##')` guard fires on empty string — leaked chain-of-thought, nested `<ul><ul>`, repeated headings, JSON parse failures), and one LLM call per lint. **Side-effect fix in same PR:** #474's `prependReasoningForParse` change dropped Query reasoning — query stream paths (openai-compat 4 sites, openai-codex added) now use `wrapReasoningContent`; anthropic stream uses the shared helper. Net -563 LOC; 3391 → 3401 tests. Closes #473.

- **Startup quick-fix completion Notice was 6 lines of "everything is fine" on a healthy vault.** The three per-check detail lines (structure / sources / incomplete) are now emitted only when that check actually needed fixing; a routine morning startup shows just title + page-count summary + disable hint.

- **Wire-up: `cacheBreakpoint` → `cache_control` on the user-message prefix, not the system block (Issue #449, PR #464).** `cacheBreakpoint` is a byte offset into the FIRST user message's text content (set by `source-analyzer.ts:404` as `staticPrefix.length`). Anthropic prompt caching is a prefix match on render order `tools → system → messages`; a marker on the system block caches `tools + system` (a few KB, below Anthropic's 1024-token minimum cacheable floor) and leaves the 75K-char user-message prefix uncached — the silent no-op class of regression that pre-fix had been shipping. Fix: replace `buildSystemWithCacheControl` (emits `SystemModelMessage[]` with `cacheControl` on the system block) with `buildMessagesWithCacheControl` (emits the first user message as two `TextPart`s cut at the offset, with `cacheControl` on the prefix part). AI SDK v6's Anthropic adapter (`@ai-sdk/anthropic/dist/index.mjs:2316-2340`) reads `cacheControl` from `TextPart.providerOptions` and emits `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` on the matching wire block. system stays a plain string. Branch D non-blocking fix (DocTpoint): call-site spread is now `...(system ? { system } : {})` (truthy-check), dropping `system: ''` from the wire. 5 tests rewritten to inspect `call.messages[0].content` as `TextPart[]` (the previous 5 pinned the wrong wire shape — `call.system` as `SystemModelMessage[]`); 1 new test covers Branch D. Wire-shape net: pre-fix had `cache_control` on system block (below cache floor → no cache hit); post-fix on user prefix → `cache_creation_input_tokens` on first call, `cached_input_tokens` on subsequent calls (all-prefix reuse). On a 2,838-page vault (75,876-char prefix) the saving is ~22-25K input tokens per post-first batch. 6 tests. Closes #449.

- **Contradictions: clamp the page in sections and restore what was withheld (#287 follow-on, PR #492).** `ContradictionManager.resolveContradiction` sent the affected page as `existingContent.substring(0, 6000)`. Three facts on that path composed badly: the prompt asks the model to preserve every existing fact and output the complete repaired page; the answer is written back over the file with `createOrUpdateFile`; nothing preserves what the model was not shown. For pages above the budget the model never saw the tail, answered with what it believed was the complete page, and the write replaced the original — **silent data loss on 55 of 2,416 knowledge pages (2.3%)** on a typical vault, with the largest page dropping four-fifths. Same family as #292 and #287, one path further along. Fix: `src/core/clamp-page-sections.ts` clamps in whole `## ` sections (drops from the end, never mid-sentence), names the omitted sections in the prompt text, returns the withheld blocks verbatim so `restoreWithheldSections` can put them back after the rewrite. Below the budget the return is byte-identical (97.7% of pages). A page over budget with no `## ` boundary (preamble alone busts the budget, or no heading at all) is refused with `hardCut: true` — the rewrite is refused rather than written back incomplete. The contradiction record is clamped through the same helper (read-only path). The merge-triage path is left alone (median 1,424 / p90 2,695 chars; the payload does not grow with the vault there). 11 + 3 tests cover byte-identity below budget, whole-section dropping, the marker, verbatim withheld blocks in document order, no-boundary hard cut, and the integration path: the prompt admits the omission and excludes the tail, the file keeps the tail anyway, and the unclamped case reaches the model unchanged. Closes #287 follow-on.

### Changed

- **Per-task policy: choose output mode and thinking per pipeline step (Issue #481, PR #490).** `taskPolicies?: TaskPolicyMap` on `LLMWikiSettings` maps a task label to `{outputMode, thinking}`, resolved specific → wildcard → default. The client wrapper applies it at the one seam every call already passes through, so **no call site changes**. An unset policy spreads `{}` and the path stays byte-identical to today. The spec format is `extract=text:on,merge-triage=text:on,page-generate=-:off`; `parseTaskPolicySpec` throws on anything it cannot read (a silently-ignored entry would mean an arm that did not run what its own manifest says it ran). Two mechanics the wire forced: a pinned `text_prompt` puts no `response_format` on the wire, so the JSON shape has to come from the prompt — `forcedTextPromptSystem` adds `JSON_ENFORCEMENT_SYSTEM_PREFIX` up front (the 400-driven demotion adds it at retry time; a pinned mode has no retry path); `low` / `medium` / `high` send `reasoning_effort` and the reasoning-strip retry deliberately drops the field (the backend just rejected it, so re-sending it would only earn a second 400). `low`/`medium`/`high` are indistinguishable on LM Studio / gemma-4-26b-a4b-qat (byte-identical output at 417 reasoning tokens); `reasoning_effort: none` does switch reasoning off. The levels are the standard openai-compatible field and are carried for the backends that honour it. The stream path is untouched — it carries no `task` label (#469), so there is nothing to key a per-step decision on. The setting is deliberately not exposed in the UI — the settings worth offering are the ones a measurement has picked out, and this field is what makes that measurement possible. 3430 → 3434 tests. Unblocks #481.

- **Extraction payload stops growing with the vault (Issue #482 stages 1+2, PR #484).** **Stage 1** removes the slug catalog that was the first block of `analyzeSource` and ~91% of its characters (2,843 lines / 69,355 chars on a mature vault). The prompt is now instructions plus the note, so its prefix is identical for every note — the best case for prefix caching — and per-note cost is a function of the note instead of the vault. Requirement 7 (`related_pages`) went with it: `source-analyzer.ts` overwrites `accumulation.relatedPages` unconditionally with the programmatic match whenever anything was extracted, so the LLM output was paid for and discarded. **Stage 2** stops showing the candidate list in generation/merge prompts and resolves every related link after generation against an index of every page: title first, then curated aliases — so `[[E433]]` lands on `entities/Polysorbate` (a connection no candidate window could contain, because the page's title is not the name in the prose). An alias claimed by two pages resolves to neither (#446 lesson); bare `[[Name]]` links are now in scope, since a prompt without a path list produces them. A name the vault does not know keeps the previous behaviour (folder from typed related lists, slug from the name) so the dead-link/stub path that requirement 3 of the generation prompt relies on is unchanged. `buildPagesListForPrompt` had no remaining caller and is removed with its facade and its tests; the #234 invariant it carried — sources/ is never a body-link target — now sits on the resolver, which cannot select a sources/ page at all. The closing commit removes the run-scoped catalog plumbing #483 added: stage 1 makes the block it stabilises unnecessary. **Acceptance measurement** (2,838-page vault): Stage 1 — 4 usable draws each, catalog arm runs round 1 then loses round 2 to the output ceiling every draw (398-421 s); stage 1 arm runs both rounds (80-110 s). Round 1 differs (`mergeBatchResults` is strictly additive; a name in only one arm cannot have been dropped by a later round). Stage 2 — 8,800 related links: 7,962 → 8,191 resolving (90.48% → 93.08%); +235 newly resolving, −6 (one class: links that resolved only because a sources/ page carried the name — the #234 invariant arriving in its new home; the resulting 6 dead links convert to stubs via Fix Dead Links, tracked separately as #485). Net -288 LOC; 3434 tests. Closes #482 stages 1+2.

## [1.26.2] - 2026-08-09

A surgical PATCH that closes the pre-submission blind spot exposed by the v1.26.1 Obsidian Bot pre-review. The bot scans the **whole repo `.ts` tree** while local `pnpm lint` only scans `src/` — and v1.26.1 shipped a blocking `no-unsafe-call` Error in `tools/llm-wiki-cli/src/obsidian.ts` that local lint never saw. **No behaviour change, no new settings, no migration.** The headline: the CLI's `obsidian.ts:117` `await import()` chain is now type-safe AND exempt from `obsidianmd/no-nodejs-modules`, and a `pnpm lint:tools-bot` script closes the local blind spot so the next release doesn't need a Bot trip to surface what local lint should have caught.

### Fixed

- **CLI `obsidian.ts:117` blocking `unsafe-call` Error (`#442`).** `await import(<dynamic-arg>)` left `request` as `any`, cascading 6 `unsafe-*` warnings and triggering `no-unsafe-call` → Error. Split into two literal `await import('node:https')` / `await import('node:http')` branches with explicit `typeof import('node:http').request` annotation — Error + the entire unsafe-* cascade disappear in one stroke.
- **`obsidian.ts:158` `requestUrl().json` contract (`#442`).** `JSON.parse(text) as unknown` + try/catch that re-throws with the status context, matching Obsidian host's behaviour on bad JSON.
- **`main.ts:443` `loadSettings` `JSON.parse` argument type (`#442`).** Now typed as `Partial<LLMWikiSettings> | null` to match `applySettingsMigrations`' declared parameter; eliminates `no-unsafe-argument`.
- **`main.ts:647` `globalThis.crypto.subtle` → `crypto.subtle` (`#442`).** Node 18+ exposes `crypto` as a global; the explicit `globalThis.` prefix was tripping `obsidianmd/no-global-this` (no-disable rule).
- **`vault.ts:291` redundant `as Record<string, unknown> | null` removed (`#442`).** `parseFrontmatter` already returns a `FrontmatterData | null` whose index signature is compatible — Bot flagged as no-op assertion.
- **`node-globals.ts:28` `(...args: any[])` → `(...args: unknown[])` (`#442`).** `Console` constructor accepts `unknown[]`; eliminates a Bot-flagged bare `any` and the `Unexpected any` warning.

### Added

- **Local `tools/` blind-spot closure: `pnpm lint:tools-bot` (`#442`).** New `eslint.tools-bot.config.mjs` (obsidianmd recommended ruleset scoped to `tools/**`, type context from `tools/llm-wiki-cli/tsconfig.json`, Node globals declared) and a matching `package.json` script (`|| true`, informational — never gates CI). Developers now see the Bot's view of the CLI tree locally instead of discovering it post-submission.
- **`Platform.isDesktop` AST guards on the three runtime-loaded `node:*` imports (`#442`).** `obsidian.ts:requestUrl()` and `node-globals.ts:plainConsole()` each carry a function-start `if (!Platform.isDesktop) throw new Error(...)`. The CLI's own Platform shim hardcodes `isDesktop: true`, so the guards never throw at runtime — they declare the desktop-only invariant the `obsidianmd/no-nodejs-modules` rule requires (verified against the rule source; bare dynamic imports are **not** exempt, contrary to the assumption baked into PR #418/#433's patterns). Mirrors `src/llm-sdk/openai-codex/loopback-flow.ts:156-160`.

### Notes for release engineering

- **Release skill v1.7.0 now mandates an Obsidian Bot pre-review (Step 6b.5, HARD STOP ②) between tag and publish.** This is the gate that should have caught v1.26.1's pre-publish — making it explicit instead of relying on the maintainer remembering to submit. See [[feedback_obsidianmd_no_nodejs_guard_detection]] for the rule-detection mechanism.
- **All 7 remaining `tools/` warnings are accepted-structural** (static `node:fs/path/fs-promises/util` imports, `.obsidian` literal, `console.log` output interface, `globalThis` shim). Dynamic form would break the 14 parser-contract tests that pin `parseCliOptions` as sync. The honest long-term fix is the **CLI split into a separate repo** ([[project_v1_27_0_cli_split_planning]]).

## [1.26.3] - 2026-08-12

A surgical PATCH that closes five UX blind spots the maintainer discovered while validating the v1.26.1 / v1.26.2 release on the production vault. None of these touch the LLM pipeline (PR #447's v1.26.3 PATCH owns that work — Phase A 3-tier state machine, Path 2 fix, Phase B 11 caller migrations, per-model placeholder demotion, pushed 2026-08-12, awaiting DocTpoint re-review); this entry covers the settings/lint/UI bugs the maintainer surfaced during the same E2E round and shipped on a separate branch (`fix/ux-b1-b2-b3-provider-statusbar-dedup`): Fetch-Models error classification (B1), status-bar cancel affordance (B2), lint dedup cross-type filter (B3), full status-bar progress i18n (B2.5), and the remaining hardcoded-English Toasts.

### Fixed

- **Settings: Fetch Models misclassified auth/endpoint/server failures as "Network" (`B1`).** `fetchOneUrl` in `model-section.ts` silently returned `[]` on non-2xx and the outer catch rewrote every error to the status-less `All URL candidates failed` — `classifyFetchError`'s regexes (`\b(401|403)\b` / `\b(404|405|...)\b` / `\b5\d\d\b`) had nothing to match, so every auth/wrong-URL/server failure surfaced as `fetchErrorNetwork`. Verified across all 7 cloud providers (OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / Kimi / MiniMax / GLM all return 401 for invalid keys; LM Studio / Ollama have no auth). `fetchOneUrl` now throws `HTTP {status}: {body-snippet}` on non-2xx; `fetchModelsWithFallback` tracks `lastHttpError` across all candidates and re-throws it; the outer catch passes the original error through unchanged. The classifier's existing regexes now hit on the first try.
  **DocTpoint CR follow-up (2026-08-12):** two unknown-case regressions the original fix introduced were closed — a 2xx with an empty/absent `data` array is now a valid `[]` return (the `HTTP 200` throw had no classifier branch → misreported Network), a true network failure is tracked as `lastNetworkError` and re-thrown as Network (previously it collapsed into `[]` → `empty model list` → the misleading `fetchErrorEmpty` for a disconnected user), and `classifyFetchError` now matches the leading `^HTTP (\d+)` BEFORE the keyword regexes so a 5xx whose body contains `unauthorized` is Server, not Auth.
- **Settings: every locale's `fetchErrorNetwork` now mentions the API Key as a fallback hint (B1).** True network failures (DNS / connection refused / timeout) still fall through to `fetchErrorNetwork` and cannot be disambiguated from auth by status alone; the fallback message now suggests checking the Key alongside network settings. 10 locales updated (`en`, `zh`, `zh-Hant`, `ja`, `ko`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt`, `it`, `ru`) with an i18n-parity test that asserts every locale's message matches a Key-mention regex.
- **UI: status-bar update path dropped the "click to cancel" label (B2).** `setStatusBarUpdateCallback` in `command-registry.ts` called `setText(text)` directly with the raw progress text, dropping the always-visible base label for the entire duration of long ingest/lint batches. Users saw `Analyzing batch 2/3 (0 entities, 5 concepts so far)...` with no indication the bar was clickable to abort. The click handler itself was already wired (line 156) — only the affordance text was missing. New `composeStatusBarUpdate` helper in `src/core/status-bar.ts` selects the active label (ingest > lint, mutex in practice) and appends it as a stage segment via `buildIngestStatusBarText`, restoring the docblock contract. The callback now hides the bar (returns null) when neither is running, instead of leaving stale text on screen.
  **DocTpoint CR follow-up (2026-08-12):** the PDF emitter (`ingestPdfSource`'s `setPdfStage`) passed an already-composed `buildIngestStatusBarText` string — which already ended in the base label — into `updateStatusBar`, so `composeStatusBarUpdate` appended the label a second time on every PDF stage (`My Note.pdf · Reading PDF… · Ingesting… · Ingesting…`). `setPdfStage` now emits raw segments (`[filename, stage].join(' · ')`) so label composition happens in exactly one place.
- **Lint dedup: cross-type pair filter (B3).** The dedup candidate generator emitted entity↔source and concept↔source pairs that shared a wiki subfolder bucket (`tp:` / `ic:` / `lh:`), polluting the LLM verify batch with nonsense questions. Per the #358 complementary memory model, a source mentioning an entity by name is NOT a duplicate of the entity — they live in different cognitive registers. Per the maintainer's 2026-08-12 direction, the dedup now considers only: entity↔entity, concept↔concept, entity↔concept, source↔source. Forbidden: entity↔source and concept↔source (in any order). New `pageTypeOf(path)` helper infers page type from `WIKI_SUBFOLDERS` segments; new `isCrossTypePairAllowed` guard rejects forbidden pairs at `addCandidate` injection time using canonicalized `smaller|larger` string keys.
  **DocTpoint CR follow-up (2026-08-12):** two B3 refinements — the anti-regression comment now states the true root cause (the canonical key `concept|entity` MUST be present in `ALLOWED_PAIR_KEYS`; the `a < b` comparison was never the miss — it produces an identical key either way, so a future editor must not 'simplify' it), and the rejected-pair count is surfaced via `hooks.onCrossTypeRejected` in the dedup-phase candidate debug line so the filter's effect is measurable.
- **Status-bar progress text fully localized (B2.5).** 16 hardcoded English status-bar strings in `wiki-engine.ts` / `conversation-ingest.ts` / `source-analyzer.ts` (e.g. `Analyzing batch 1/3...`, `[7/10] Concept: <name>`) produced mixed-language bars on non-English vaults. 18 new i18n keys (status-bar stage + `Entity`/`Concept` type labels) across 10 locales; every `onProgress` string now flows through `getText()`. 22 i18n-parity tests pin the placeholder contract (`{current}` `{total}` `{filename}` etc.) so a translator dropping a placeholder fails loudly.
- **Remaining hardcoded English Toasts localized (B2.5 follow-up).** User E2E found `Ingesting: <file>` Toasts still English while the status bar was fully localized. Full sweep of every `new Notice()` / `showProgressFor()` call site found exactly three hardcoded strings — `Ingesting: {filename}` (single-file manual ingest), `Checking for already-ingested files...` (batch pre-scan), and `<N> findings` (auto-lint completion). 3 new i18n keys + 10 locales; `lintFindingsSummary` is a full phrase (`{total} findings`) so each locale can order/pluralize freely. 22 i18n-parity tests.

- **`repetitionPenalty` user setting was a silent no-op on every shipped provider (Issue #414, PR #453).** Since the v1.23.0 AI SDK migration dropped the pre-AI-SDK `unsupportedFields` blocklist, the setting flowed through to wire on no path: LM Studio / Ollama / llama.cpp received the wrong spelling (`repetition_penalty` with `-ion`; llama.cpp recognizes `repeat_penalty` per DocTpoint #414 type-error test on gemma-4-12b); Kimi / OpenRouter / vLLM saw the field placed under `providerOptions.openaiCompatible` while the AI SDK's openai-compat passthrough at `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@2.0.62/dist/index.mjs:525-540` reads `providerOptions[this.providerOptionsName]` (the provider id) — the key mismatch meant the lookup missed for every provider; Anthropic received the field but its Messages API has no `repetition_penalty` (only `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k`); DeepSeek / OpenAI / OpenAI Codex / Ollama (OpenAI-compat) / Gemini / MiniMax / GLM / Bedrock-OpenAI do not list the field at all. **Per-provider dialect dispatch in `OpenAICompatSdkClient.buildProviderOptions`:** `lmstudio` / `ollama` → wire `repeat_penalty` (no `-ion`); `kimi` / `openrouter` / `custom` → wire `repetition_penalty` (snake_case, OpenAI-spec); `deepseek` / `gemini` / `minimax` / `glm` / `bedrock-openai` / unknown → field dropped silently. The return key flips from `{ openaiCompatible: openaiOpts }` to `{ [this.provider]: openaiOpts }` so the SDK's per-id-key passthrough delivers the field. The Anthropic client drops the field entirely instead of placing an unrecognized key on the wire — matches the 10-locale i18n text *"cloud providers will silently ignore it"*. OpenAI / Codex unchanged. The dialect table + `repetitionPenaltyWireField(provider)` helper lives in `src/core/repetition-penalty-dialect.ts` (re-exported from `openai-compat-sdk-client.ts` for test parity; placed in core to avoid a circular `core↔llm-sdk` import — see [[project_v1_26_3_pr454]]). **No 400-strip retry** for `repetitionPenalty`: the setting is user-opt-in (not a plugin default), so a backend rejection should surface to the user rather than be silently swallowed (dead-code-as-docs policy + half-life rule). One-line `console.debug` (`[REPETITION-PENALTY-EMIT]`, mirrors `[REASONING-STRIP-DEBUG]`) so users with developer-mode debugging can verify the wire contract on their backend. **Known limitation:** `wrapWithAdvancedSettings` (`src/llm-client-wrapper.ts`) uses `Object.create(client)` to inherit `createMessageStream` without settings injection — `repetitionPenalty` (and all other settings) is silently dropped on the stream path (Query Wiki, streaming UI). Tracked as [#451](https://github.com/green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki/issues/451) for v1.27.0; this fix lands only on the non-stream path. Closes #414. 3212 tests / 230 files (+3 are the new dialect dispatch tests).

- **Frontmatter writer silently emptied the `sources:` field on re-ingest (Issue #438, PR #450).** `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` ran AFTER `preserveExistingSources` was already merged, so the final write dropped any pre-existing `sources` value that didn't satisfy the new constraint — silently. **DocTpoint Finding 1 fix (commit `2560ab4`):** filter empty-string entries from `preservedSources` before merging, so a bare `sources:` header (no values) no longer re-emits as `sources:\n  - ""`. **Finding 2 (whole-class passthrough via `extractPassthroughLines`)** tracked as a follow-up PR — same PR series, separate commit. Per-vault impact: 321 affected pages in the maintainer's vault. CHANGELOG-side note: previously this regression was hidden by the v1.25.11 frontmatter-writer audit (which validated YAML shape, not value preservation); the fix lives at the writer-merge layer.

- **Placeholder detector missed `{"": {}}` / `{"": []}` empty-object/array variants (Issue #443 follow-up, PR #454).** The grammar-constrained JSON-repair gate (`isPlaceholderObject` in `src/core/json.ts`) only caught `{"": ""}` (empty string under the empty key). User E2E on LM Studio / qwen3.5-9b (2026-08-13) showed the model emits an empty OBJECT or ARRAY under the empty key when the grammar token is pluralised — both bypassed the existing gate and returned the broken JSON to the caller, triggering the source-analyzer's empty-result path. The detector now uses a single-pass `Object.entries(...).every(isEmptyJsonValue)` over all keys (not just the first), so empty object/array/string/number/null variants are caught uniformly. The throw-wiring test in `wiki-engine-repetition-penalty-hint.test.ts` confirms the placeholder gate still routes failures to the "Source analysis failed" path with the localized repetitionPenalty hint attached (gated by `core/repetition-penalty-dialect.ts` so providers that never put `repetitionPenalty` on the wire don't get a misleading hint — see the #414 entry above).

- **RepetitionPenalty UX hint on `Source analysis failed` (PR #454).** User feedback 2026-08-13 (LM Studio / gemma-4-12b / qwen3.5-9b): when a custom `repetitionPenalty` value silently broke grammar-constrained extraction (qwen3.5-9b), the user-facing error was a generic `Source analysis failed` with no mention of the setting. New `buildRepetitionPenaltyHint(language, value, provider)` helper appends a localized hint to the throw site (`wiki-engine.ts:905-908`) ONLY when (a) the user opted into a custom value AND (b) the active provider actually puts the field on the wire (`repetitionPenaltyWireField(provider) !== null`). Hint suppressed on anthropic/deepseek/gemini/minimax/glm — never put the field on the wire, so a "reduce or clear" hint would be misinformation. Settings description extended in 10 locales (the existing `repetitionPenaltyDesc` i18n text already warned about silent-drop on cloud providers — the new failure-path hint is a complementary UX surface for the wire-supporting subset).

### Notes for release engineering

- **Five PRs land in this PATCH.** **#447** (LLM pipeline, 39 commits, Phase A 3-tier + Path 2 + Phase B 11 caller migrations + per-model placeholder demotion) + **#448** (UX fixes, 10 commits, B1-B3 + B2.5 + Toast i18n) + **#453** (Issue #414 dialect, 4 commits: client + wire-shape tests + Anthropic drop + 400-strip documentation) + **#450** (Issue #438 sources-loss, 1 commit for Finding 1; Finding 2 follows separately) + **#454** (placeholder detector widening + repetitionPenalty UX, 4 commits: detector + UX + simplify/code-review cleanup + provider gate). #450 + #454 still awaiting DocTpoint re-review at tag time; release is held until both clear.
- **No settings-schema change, no migration, no key rename.** **21 new i18n keys** (18 B2.5 status-bar + 3 Toast) added across all 10 locales + the `fetchErrorNetwork` value change + 1 `repetitionPenaltyErrorHint` key + the existing `repetitionPenaltyDesc` extension. i18n-parity guards (bidirectional + placeholder-drift + non-empty) pin all new content; existing fetch-flow regression guards pin the HTTP-status re-throw behaviour; new dialect-dispatch tests pin the per-id-key passthrough at the wire boundary; new `wiki-engine-repetition-penalty-hint.test.ts` pins the throw-site wiring.
- **Test count growth.** v1.26.2 → v1.26.3: **2992 → 3305 tests** (+313 / +12 net files after 5 PRs land). Per-PR deltas: #447 +135 / #448 +58 / #453 +3 / #450 +4 / #454 +5. Composition and full regression-guard list in [ROADMAP v1.26.3 PATCH track](./ROADMAP.md).
- **CLI repo split is now live in v1.27.0 scope (see [ROADMAP §v1.27.0](./ROADMAP.md#v1270-minor-design-track)).** The in-tree `tools/llm-wiki-cli/` remains the canonical CLI source until v1.27.0 ships; the README §Headless CLI was rewritten to point at the published `karpathywiki-cli` npm package + the standalone sibling repo [`green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki-cli`](https://github.com/green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki-cli). No code change; only user-facing docs.

## [1.26.1] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- **`parseJsonResult` discriminated union for LLM JSON parse outcomes (Issue #407 Stage 0, PR #436, commit `ad02b0e`).** No behaviour change; the union gives the failure a name: `{ok: true, value}` / `{ok: false, reason: 'empty' | 'malformed' | 'exception'}`, so a parse failure can no longer be read as a negative answer, and under the union `parsed?.field || fallback` stops compiling at a call site that ignores the distinction. Every current call site keeps the old `parseJsonResponse` and is untouched — identity shown over 776 input combinations across return value, thrown error, and the full console call sequence including `debug`. Call-site migration follows in Stages 1+2 as one PR per site, starting with the two highest-blast sites, `path-resolution.ts:220` and `conversation-ingest.ts:337`.

- **Per-step LLM timing ledger (PR #409, eucher).** Each `createMessage` call now carries a `task` label naming the pipeline step; a process-global ledger (`src/core/llm-task-usage.ts`) accumulates call count + wall-millis per label at the single seam every call passes through (`wrapWithAdvancedSettings`). Callers snapshot before the work and diff after — deliberate, since a reset would be wrong the moment two ingests overlap. A phase as large as page generation (one interval covering path resolution, dedup call, page writes, merge routing) now decomposes into per-step timings, so a slow ingest says *which* step to look at. The ledger is cumulative for the process; an unlabelled call lands in `'untagged'` rather than being dropped, so the table never under-reports the run it exists to explain.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate `sources:` frontmatter key on stub-created concept pages (Issue #399, PR #405, commit `4c43cdfb`).** v1.25.11 regression in `appendSourceSlugToFrontmatter`; produced two top-level `sources:` keys (invalid YAML) on post-stub ingests, breaking Obsidian Properties render. Two-sided fix in `buildStubContent` + `appendSourceSlugToFrontmatter`. Corpus: 321 affected pages in @borthwick's vault. 5 new unit tests + 3 parser-shape guards (real `yaml` package assertion that `sources` is `string[]`).
- **CLI: per-run bundle isolation prevents concurrent-run corruption (PR #408, commit `7f864f1`).** Two concurrent `ingest --help` runs raced esbuild's in-place bundle write (14 of 60 failed with `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input` on `main` 2a42241). Fix: per-process bundle name + `process.kill(pid, 0)` liveness sweep at startup + post-import `rm` (Node keeps loaded module + inline sourcemap). 20 of 20 clean after fix. No config / API / env-var change.
- **Dedup-phase in-scan concurrency halving was inert (CR-1, post-v1.26.0 code review).** `consecutiveThrottleChunks` + `HALVE_AFTER_CONSECUTIVE_CHUNKS` were declared inside the chunk-iteration for-loop body in `src/wiki/lint/llm-phases/dedup-phase.ts`, so the counter reset to 0 at every chunk and could never reach the halving threshold of 2. Result: the v1.26.0 Batch 2 attribution "979s→365s e2e gain on the 2141-page vault came from force-disable + halving + 500ms backoff" was wrong on the halving factor — only the retry/backoff mechanism delivered the gain; halving was dead code in practice. Fix: hoist the two declarations above the loop (alongside `currentConcurrency`) so the counter accumulates across chunks. New regression-guard test in `src/__tests__/wiki/lint/llm-phases/dedup-phase.test.ts` ("runDedupPhase — in-scan concurrency halving (CR-1 regression guard)") with 4-pair caseVariant fixture + `systemPrompt.length = 7000+` to force chunkSize=1 + `pageGenerationConcurrency = 2` + per-prompt mock (1st call → '', 2nd → valid JSON). Asserts the `"temporarily reducing in-scan concurrency 2 → 1"` warn line fires. Attribution correction: see [[feedback_dedup_phase_halving_dead_code]] + [[feedback_force_disable_thinking_openai_compat_noop]] for the full 979s→365s→151s chain.
- **Six reasoning-budget-sensitive `TOKENS_*` caps raised to 3000 (Issue #403, PR #429).** Short-JSON output call sites (`{strategy, path}`, `{keywords: []}`, `{kind: "entity"}`) were sized for non-reasoning models; on reasoning-capable models the deliberation is billed against the same `max_tokens` budget as the answer, so the cap was burned before content. DocTpoint measurement on `gemma-4-12b / LM Studio / 2.4 KB source × 45 calls`: 14 truncated, 13 of those empty; `complementaryAppend` was 3/3 = 100% miss at its 600 cap. Bumped to 3000 uniformly: `TOKENS_DEDUP_RESOLUTION` 1000 → 3000, `TOKENS_MERGE_TRIAGE` 2000 → 3000, `TOKENS_COMPLEMENTARY_APPEND` 600 → 3000 (the three #403 primary sites), plus three same-pattern sites surfaced by the post-#403 audit pass: `TOKENS_LINT_ALIAS_BATCH` 500 → 3000, `TOKENS_LINT_ORPHAN_FIX` 800 → 3000, `TOKENS_QUERY_KEYWORDS` 1000 → 3000. ~50–80% reasoning headroom while keeping the cap well below the call's context window. Per-call reasoning-aware multiplier is deferred to v1.27.0's per-call `thinkingPolicy` enum (scope item 6).
- **CHANGELOG v1.26.0 entry: `thinking` / `chat_template_kwargs` never reached the wire correction (Issue #420, PR #420).** Replaced the "SDK's `filter()` silently drops them" framing with the actual mechanism verified by DocTpoint: the SDK's `filter()` at `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@2.0.62/dist/index.mjs:531-540` is a **passthrough** for undeclared keys (copies them verbatim), but it reads from `providerOptions[<provider id>]` (e.g. `lmstudio` / `deepseek`) while `buildProviderOptions` returns them under the hardcoded `openaiCompatible` key, which no shipped provider id matches — the fields were **misaddressed**, not filtered. `reasoningEffort: 'none'` is the only verified-working disable (it IS declared in the schema and emits as `reasoning_effort: 'none'` on the wire at `:541`).
- **CHANGELOG + ROADMAP: Bedrock Stage 2 (SSO/Profile auth) planning entry recorded (Issue #425, PR #426).** Cancels the prior "≥3 user requests" gate. Implementation window v1.26.x PATCH / v1.27.0 via a zero-AWS-SDK path: hand-rolled IAM Identity Center OIDC (reusing the Codex OAuth skeleton) → `GetRoleCredentials` → temp IAM creds → hand-written SigV4 signer → existing `bedrock-mantle` endpoint. ~+10 KB bundle, zero new npm deps (vs the rejected PR #263's +1.2 MB). Issue #425 milestone: v1.27.0+ research. PR #263 author notified with the new decision ([comment 5218259440](https://github.com/green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki/pull/263#issuecomment-5218259440)).
- **`--seed` is no longer documented as honoured by every local server (Issue #423, PR #434, commit `8826710`).** Docs-only. Three sites promised strict seed honouring: the flag table in `tools/llm-wiki-cli/README.md`, the `--help` text in `tools/llm-wiki-cli/src/main.ts`, and the `samplingSeed` doc comment in `src/types.ts`. Measured on LM Studio / `google/gemma-4-12b` (MLX, 4bit) the field is accepted and type-validated (`seed: "abc"` answers HTTP 400 naming `llm.prediction.seed`) and then ignored: five requests at `seed: 42`, `temperature: 1.0` returned five distinct outputs, as did five requests with no seed at all — only `temperature: 0` returned a single output. Nothing in the exchange tells the caller the run is not reproducible, which is what made the sentence costly rather than merely optimistic. The `openai` / Anthropic / Codex exceptions are accurate and stay verbatim.
- **A page keeps its own H1 through an LLM body rewrite (Issue #419, PR #422, commit `cddd460`; hardened for Issue #435, PR #437, commit `8eb3948`).** `reassertH1` restored the title with `rewrite.replace(current, previous)`, wrong twice over: the replacement string processes `$` escapes, so a title the function exists to keep verbatim was mutated (`# Kosten $$500 und $& im Titel` came back as `# Kosten $500 und # Kosten im Titel`), and `replace` substitutes the first occurrence anywhere in the body rather than the matched line, so a preceding line quoting the title took the restore while the real H1 kept the model's version. Both are repaired by splicing at `exec().index`. #435 then removed the remaining assumption behind that match — **H1 re-assertion hardened against frontmatter and code-fence comment lines**: `findH1` walks the lines once and skips a `---` block in frontmatter position (further down it is a thematic break) and any fenced block, closed by its own opening marker. The read side is the mass-mutation case the file-name approach was rejected for in #419 — a `# ` shell comment inside a bash example could be adopted as the page's previous title and mint a title for a page that never had one. The same repair applies to `mergeDuplicatePages`, which adopts `parsed.body` as the merged body. 2 + 6 tests; the thematic-break test pins the boundary rather than fixing it.
- **`yaml` declared in `devDependencies` (Issue #424, PR #431, commit `64601ee`).** Clean-install regression: `yaml@2.8.3` was only transitive via vite peer in vitest → eslint-plugin-obsidianmd → yaml-eslint-parser, so pnpm's strict isolation kept it nested under `vite/node_modules/yaml`. The `append-source-slug.test.ts` import (`import { parse as parseYaml } from 'yaml'`) failed to collect on a fresh `pnpm install` from `main`. Two things had hidden the regression: `release.yml` uses `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (flat layout hoists), and the release workflow runs `npm run build` only — no test step, so a file that fails to collect never turns CI red. Fix: declare `^2.4.2` in `devDependencies`; lockfile regenerated per `pre-release-gate` §2f.2.
- **Query wiki: silent-success defect on Save (Issue #398, PR #432, commit `e2071af`).** User clicks "Save to Wiki" on a conversation; the notice said "Conversation saved to Wiki!" but no file was written. Three notices flashed: "Checking for existing knowledge" → "Konversation im Wiki gespeichert!" → "0 entities, 0 concepts, 0 pages" (or "0实体, 0概念, 0页" in zh-CN locale). Root cause: `src/wiki/conversation-ingest.ts:78-93` returns early with `success: true`, `createdPages: []`, `entitiesCreated: 0`, `conceptsCreated: 0`, `errorMessage: 'Knowledge already exists in Wiki'` when `checkDedup` returns `status: 'fully_redundant'` — but `QueryView.saveToWiki` displayed an unconditional "saved!" notice without surfacing `report.errorMessage`. Silent-success defect (UI lied about what actually happened). Two-layer fix: (a) UX layer — `noticeTail` conditional append when `report.errorMessage` is set; i18n key `querySaveAlreadyExists` added to all 10 locales. (b) Diagnostic layer — `console.debug` for the dedup verdict + `console.warn` when save is skipped, so the user can inspect DevTools to see the LLM's actual verdict. 3 regression tests pin the silent-success contract.

### Issue state (administrative)

Issue tracker had drifted from the v1.26.0 merge history (no `Closes #N` in PRs #401 / #406 / #410 / #411 commit messages, so auto-close-on-merge never fired). Closed administratively on 2026-08-07:

- **#382** [v1.26.0 hardening] — all 5 P0+P1 batches shipped in v1.26.0 via PRs #401 / #406 / #410 / #411.
- **#328** [schema layer rethink] — Phase 1 closed by PR #331 (2026-07-22). Phase 2/3 deferred to v1.27.0+.
- **#402** [providerOptions stripped] — `response_format` closed by `ca4a24d` (2026-07-29); `repetitionPenalty` split to #414.
- **#399** — see Fixed section above.

### Security

- **24 Dependabot alerts closed via transitive devDep upgrade (Dependabot batch 2026-08-08).** All 24 alerts were in **transitive devDependencies** only — production runtime (`@ai-sdk/*`, `openai`, `anthropic`, etc.) was untouched. Bumped 4 root devDeps so the 4 vulnerable transitives resolve to safe versions:
  - `fast-uri` `3.1.4` → **`3.1.5`** (added as direct devDep so pnpm hoists it; override updated) — closes 3 alerts (#1, #30, #31)
  - `undici` `7.27.2` → **`8.10.0`** via `jsdom@^30.0.1` — closes **16 alerts** (#5-#11, #18-#27)
  - `postcss` `8.5.15` → **`8.5.26`** via `vite@^8.2.1` (vitest peer re-resolved) — closes 3 alerts (#12, #34, #35)
  - `vite` `8.0.13` → **`8.2.1`** via direct devDep — closes 2 alerts (#3, #4)
  - Plus `ajv@^8.20.0` added to devDeps (pulls the safe `fast-uri`)
  - Plus `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd@^0.4.1` + `vitest@^4.1.10` range-widened to latest

  All 24 alerts now have `first_patched_version ≤ installed version` per Dependabot's metadata; GitHub auto-closes on next lockfile re-scan post-merge. Zero runtime impact (`fast-uri`/`undici`/`postcss`/`vite` never appear in `main.js` — verified by `grep -c` against the built bundle, 0 hits each). Gate 1 green on the new lockfile: lint 0/0, tsc 0, 2980 tests passing (217 files), build clean, css-lint 0 violations.

  **Known CI-only carry-over:** npm-audit (registry-local advisory DB) flags an additional `brace-expansion@1.1.16` / `2.1.2` transitive reachability through `eslint-plugin-import` / `eslint-plugin-n` / `eslint-plugin-react` / `eslint-plugin-json-schema-validator`. GitHub Dependabot does NOT flag these (no open alert for `brace-expansion`). The npm `overrides` field syntax to cascade (`eslint-plugin-import > brace-expansion: 5.0.9`) is incompatible with pnpm's `parseCatalogProtocol` (`bareSpecifier.startsWith is not a function`) — flat overrides work in both, but flat overrides do not cascade into grand-children transitive deps on npm's side. pnpm's hoisting deduplicates everything to a single `5.0.9` via flat override. Resolving the npm-side carry-over requires either (a) migrating CI to pnpm, (b) using pnpm-only overrides via `pnpm.overrides` (subtly different field), or (c) replacing `eslint-plugin-import` / `eslint-plugin-n` / `eslint-plugin-react` with non-vulnerable alternatives. **Out of scope for v1.26.1** — the runtime bundle is unaffected, Dependabot considers it resolved.

### Tracked in v1.26.x PATCH (no fix yet)

- **#407** — `parseJsonResponse` parse failures indistinguishable from negative answers at 7-12 sites (high-blast: `path-resolution.ts:220` + `conversation-ingest.ts:337`). Stage 0 shipped as PR #436 (see *Added* above); the call sites still read a failure as a negative answer until Stages 1+2 port them, one PR per site.
- **#414** — `repetitionPenalty` setting inert (split from #402). DocTpoint's per-backend measurement 2026-08-07 on LM Studio / gemma-4-12b confirmed: `repetition_penalty` is silently discarded on this backend; the correct spelling is `repeat_penalty` (llama.cpp style) for LM Studio / llama.cpp and `repetition_penalty` for vLLM / OpenRouter. Path = per-backend spelling transform. **Gap**: DeepSeek / Kimi / GLM / Ollama / vLLM unmeasured.

### Planned — Bedrock Stage 2 (SSO/Profile auth, 2026-08-07 decision)

**Scope.** Adds AWS SSO / Profile login to the existing `bedrock-anthropic` / `bedrock-openai` providers via a **zero-AWS-SDK** path (cancels the prior "≥3 user requests" gate). Mechanism: hand-rolled IAM Identity Center OIDC device-code flow (reusing the Codex OAuth skeleton at `src/llm-sdk/openai-codex/`) → `GetRoleCredentials` → temp IAM creds → hand-written SigV4 signer → existing `bedrock-mantle` endpoint (`bedrockMantleMessagesUrl` / `bedrockMantleChatCompletionsUrl`). ~+10 KB bundle, zero new npm deps.

**Why this replaces the rejected PR #263 approach.** #263 shipped `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` + `@aws-sdk/credential-providers` for the same feature at **+1.2 MB** (bearer users pay it too — esbuild single-file CJS cannot lazy-load). The `bedrock-mantle` endpoint accepts AWS credentials (SigV4) per AWS docs and speaks standard OpenAI/Anthropic protocols over plain SSE — so SSO needs only the OIDC login flow + a hand-writable SigV4 signer (~300 LOC, `crypto.subtle`, AWS test vectors). No AWS SDK required.

**Design record:** `~/.claude/.../memory/project_bedrock_stage2_codex_style_sigv4.md` (implementation checklist). Target window: v1.26.x PATCH or v1.27.0.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-08-05

MINOR. Anchored at [#358](https://github.com/green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki/issues/358) (complementary memory model). User-visible surface from this release: the headless ingest CLI, #383 boundary follow-up, dual-key bucketed dedup, cross-type dedup candidate expansion, dedup threshold advanced tunables, real wire-level force-disable thinking (4-layer fallback), parse-failure routing into `dedupFailures`, dead-code-as-docs governance, Russian i18n, and three DocTpoint PRs (`#357` source-lemma, `#386` vault-wide link retarget, `#388` `created:` provenance). The complementary-memory design items (per-type registration, typed edges, bidirectional frontmatter, identity ambiguity, Preview-Confirm, stable mutation interface) are scoped but not implemented in this release — they remain v1.26.x follow-on work and are tracked in `docs/v1.26.0-design.md` plus the issues listed there.

> **Composition.** 115 commits on top of v1.25.11, 110 files changed, +10,604 / −994 LOC, **2928 tests / 213 files passing**. The Batches 1-4 P0+P1 hardening was added on top of the originally-shipped CLI surface; v1.26.0 is the first MINOR in the project that carries P0+P1 hardening into the same tag.

### Added

- **Headless ingest CLI is now discoverable (PR #372 + #387).** The engine under `tools/llm-wiki-cli/` previously shipped with no `bin`, no pnpm script, and no mention in any README — a fresh clone could not find it. Exposes it as `llm-wiki` (bin) plus `pnpm llm-wiki` (script) and sets the executable bit on `run-llm-wiki.mjs` so `npm install` produces `node_modules/.bin/llm-wiki`. The tool is named `llm-wiki` rather than `wiki-ingest` so it can grow beyond ingest into a general wiki-management CLI (lint, query, mutation) without a later rename. Note: pnpm 10 does not link the root package's bin to `node_modules/.bin/`, so the pnpm-user entry point is `pnpm llm-wiki` (not `pnpm exec llm-wiki`); npm users see `./node_modules/.bin/llm-wiki`.
- **🛠️ Tools H2 section in all 10 READMEs.** One paragraph pointing at the CLI's flag reference, environment requirements, and shim caveats — links out to `tools/llm-wiki-cli/README.md` (absolute GitHub URL so the readme-links test stays green).
- **Source-slug deterministic merge (PR #357, DocTpoint).** Replaces the LLM-only merge judgement with a deterministic "source-slug = page-lemma" path so a re-ingest of the source that produced a page cannot fail to merge that page into its own subject on the second pass.
- **Real wire-level force-disable thinking, 4-layer fallback (PR #411, Batch 6).** Prior versions shipped `thinking.type = 'disabled'` as a wire disable, but they never reached the request body. The AI SDK's `openaiCompatibleLanguageModelChatOptions` zod schema (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@2.0.62/dist/index.mjs:322-344`) does not declare `thinking` / `chat_template_kwargs` — on its own that would not have stopped them, because the `filter()` at `:531-540` is the passthrough for undeclared keys: it copies them into the body verbatim and skips only the keys the schema already handles. It reads them from `providerOptions[<provider id>]` (`lmstudio` / `deepseek` / …), while `buildProviderOptions` returns them under the hardcoded `openaiCompatible` key, which no shipped provider id matches — so the fields were misaddressed, not filtered. Layer 1: `reasoningEffort: 'none'` is declared in the schema and the SDK emits it as `reasoning_effort: 'none'` on the wire (`:541`) — the only verified-working disable. Layer 2: co-emit `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }` + `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking = false` for the Anthropic path (uses a different field that the Anthropic SDK accepts). Layer 3: on HTTP 400 mentioning `reasoning_effort` / `thinking` / `chat_template`, retry once with `reasoningEffort` stripped. Per-baseURL cache prevents infinite loops. Layer 4: "**Do not reason step by step**" line in the dedup prompt. **User-facing impact on a 2141-page vault**: wall-time 979s → 365s (Batch 2 retry only) → **151s after Layers 1-3 went live** (−85% vs baseline, −59% vs Batch 2). Per-call `thinkingPolicy` (the JSON-repair path at `source-analyzer.ts:417` always allows reasoning — DocTpoint measurement showed disabling it produces structurally valid JSON with wrong content) is deferred to v1.26.x PATCH.
- **Dual-key bucketed dedup, Batch 1 rev 2 (PR #401).** `partitionPagesMultiBucket` partitions pages into `tp-prefix` (title-prefix) + `lh-link-hash` (link-hash) buckets before the O(n²) `generateDuplicateCandidates` scan. Bucket boundary emits `checkCancelled()` so the user can interrupt mid-scan. Pure refactor on legacy vaults (≥95% recall on synthetic N=200 pages vs 80-90% on the previous single-bucket baseline); memory peak O(N² candidates) → O(B² per bucket).
- **Cross-type dedup candidate expansion, Batch 2 (PR #410).** `generateDuplicateCandidates` now surfaces candidates across entity / concept / file types when the shared-link signal crosses type boundaries, and the dedup phase ships an inline empty-response retry + backoff + concurrency halving on transient burst load (LLMs that return 200 + 0-byte body under burst). User-facing impact: 2141-page vault dedup 979s → 365s after retry/backoff live. Threshold inputs (see Changed) are user-tunable. The companion `lintDedupIncludeSources` toggle (per-source-file dedup scope filter) relocates to the bottom Advanced settings panel — it was originally misplaced in the LLM Advanced section.
- **Russian i18n, full UI + wiki-output + README (PR #397).** 667 new keys in `src/texts/ru.ts`; full `docs/README_RU.md` translation; 11-way language switcher across all READMEs; system-prompt section labels for wiki output. 10→11 locales. i18n-parity test enforces bidirectional coverage.
- **Vault-wide link retarget for `mergeDuplicates` (#386, PR #392, DocTpoint).** `merge-duplicates.ts` previously retargeted links only inside the surviving page's body; links from sibling pages pointing at either the surviving page or the deleted page now also get rewritten vault-wide and across every alias form before the delete commits. Closes #386.
- **Frontmatter `created:` provenance (#388, PR #396, DocTpoint).** `create-page.ts` and `fill-empty-page.ts` now take `created:` from the caller (`new Date().toISOString()`); never read from the LLM-generated content. Closes #388 — the previous shape could echo an LLM-hallucinated old date into freshly-created pages.
- **Dead-code-as-docs governance (Batch 4, policy only — no functional change).** CLAUDE.md §"Dead-code-as-docs policy" + `pre-release-gate` Phase 2g audit. Exported helpers with zero production importers now have a one-release half-life: either wire into production before the next MINOR or delete before the next MINOR. Two prior instances on record (v1.25.10 PATCH `lint-analysis-cache.ts` + `lint-smart-skip.ts` shipped as dead code and survived until v1.26.0 Batch 3 deletion; v1.25.0 PDF cache-only helpers followed the same pattern). Two is a pattern; three would be a culture. P1-1/P1-2 from v1.25.10 PATCH #367 deleted as part of this governance (PR #406).

### Changed

- **`--thinking on|off` → `--thinking-mode data-json | plugin-off | server-default`.** The old flag was a two-state surface that hid the three outcomes the plugin can actually produce: leave `data.json` alone, force-disable reasoning, or defer to the server's preset. `on` looked like "enable reasoning" but actually meant "defer to server default" — a footgun. The new flag makes all three states explicit. The legacy `--thinking` throws a deprecation error pointing at the new flag and the v1.27.0 removal target; it does NOT silently translate, so a `--thinking on` typo can't keep working long after the deprecation is forgotten.
- **`--max-rounds` → `--round-base`.** The old name was actively misleading: it set the granularity's `maxBatchesBase` field, not a ceiling. The actual ceiling is `min(base * 3, ceil(source_chars / 2000) + 2)`, so `--round-base 6` allows up to 18 rounds, and on a short source the length term wins regardless. Renaming to `--round-base` describes what the flag actually sets. The internal `GRANULARITY_CONFIG.maxBatchesBase` field is unchanged (engine contract, not CLI surface). Legacy `--max-rounds` throws a deprecation error.
- **Picker exclusion rule centralised (PR #389 follow-up to #383).** `FileSuggestModal`, `FolderSuggestModal`, and `MultiFileSuggestModal` previously each open-coded the wiki + configDir filter. They now share a single `isExcludedFromSourcePicker` primitive in `src/core/folder-scope.ts`. The original `FolderSuggestModal` also held the same unanchored-prefix leak class `folder-scope.ts` was created to eliminate (`.obsidian-backup/` next to `.obsidian/`) — closed as part of the centralisation.
- **Dedup threshold constants extracted + user-tunable (PR #395, Batch 2 surface area).** `LINT_DEDUP_JACCARD_LINK_THRESHOLD`, `LINT_DEDUP_JACCARD_BODY_GATE`, `LINT_DEDUP_BIGRAM_THRESHOLD` extracted from `src/wiki/lint/duplicate-detection.ts` to `src/constants.ts` (Lint Performance Knobs block). `generateDuplicateCandidates` now accepts a `DuplicateDetectionThresholds` options-object; defaults preserve legacy behavior. Three user-settable inputs in **Settings → LLM Configuration → Advanced → Custom** ("Duplicate detection thresholds" subsection): shared-link duplicate threshold, body-similarity floor, title/alias similarity threshold. Leave blank = constant default. **Tier-1 cutoff (`LINT_DEDUP_BIGRAM_TIER1_CUTOFF = 0.6`) is NOT user-settable** — controls LLM budget allocation; user-tunable would let users silently flood or drop LLM candidates. New bottom "Advanced settings" panel (separate from the LLM Advanced section) hosts the three threshold inputs + `lintDedupIncludeSources`.

### Fixed

- **FolderSuggestModal leaked the wiki folder itself as a pickable source/watched folder (#383 PR #384 follow-up, PR #389).** `isInFolderScope(folder, wikiFolder, false)` is false for the folder itself (a folder is not a descendant of itself); without an explicit identity check, the wiki folder re-entered the folder picker after PR #384 landed. New `isAtOrInFolderScope` primitive in `src/core/folder-scope.ts` makes the "folder itself OR anything inside it" semantics a single tested rule.
- **Three of PR #384's per-site regression tests pinned nothing (#383 PR #384 follow-up, PR #389).** The `delete-empty-stubs`, `merge-duplicates` (deleted — see below), and `auto-maintain` tests rebuilt the filter expression inside the test file and asserted against the copy — reverting the source line left them green. Rewritten as real production-function tests: `deleteEmptyStubs` (5 cases: leak direction + substantive content + reviewed:true + protected paths + deleteFile throw), `normalizeSourcesInFolder` (3 cases: leak direction + clean file + read throw). The `merge-duplicates` site is intentionally NOT covered by this release — #386 (assigned to DocTpoint) replaces that filter and owns its own coverage.
- **`auto-maintain.ts` Phase 2 extracted to a module function (`normalizeSourcesInFolder` in `src/core/sources-normalizer.ts`).** Previously inline in `runStartupCheck`, which sleeps 3 seconds and depends on the wikiEngine/plugin surfaces — neither is testable from the startup surface. The new module function mirrors the Phase 3 shape (`findIncompletePages`) so every startup phase follows the same module-function pattern.
- **Dedup-phase parse-failures were silently merged with legitimate-empty results (Batch 7, PR #411).** `dedup-phase.ts` collapsed `null` (parse-fail / truncated) and `{"duplicates": []}` (LLM said "no duplicates") into the same `[]` outcome; neither was routed to `dedupFailures`. Fix: structured `type: 'parse-failure'` discriminator on each `dedupFailures` entry; `isRateLimitFailure` predicate now accepts a structured item and bails early on `type: 'parse-failure'`. Both `detectRateLimitFailures` and the dedup-phase consumer now pass the full item (CR-3 wiring fix — the structured branch was previously unreachable in production because consumers passed `f.reason` string only; a regression test in `rate-limit.test.ts` pins the discriminator through `detectRateLimitFailures`).
- **Two-marker (verb + field) classifier for reasoning-field 400 errors (Batch 6 CR-2).** Prior single-substring classifier included the bare word `thinking`, which collides with model names (`kimi-k2-thinking`, `qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507`, `glm-4.6-thinking`). Any 400 on these models — bad model name, context-length exceeded, max_tokens mismatch — was misclassified as a reasoning-field rejection, permanently marked the baseURL as "strip" (silently disabling force-disable-thinking for the rest of the session), AND consumed the 400 so the token-key fallback never fired. Two-marker classifier (rejection verb + field marker) rejects all four false positives while still catching real rejections.

### Performance

- **Lint dedup-phase empty-response retry (Batch 2).** Inline retry on `null` LLM response with 500ms attempt-2 backoff; concurrency-halving on consecutive throttled chunks. **Deferred**: the concurrency-halving counter (`HALVE_AFTER_CONSECUTIVE_CHUNKS = 2`) was scoped inside the per-batch `for` loop body and never reached the threshold — see v1.26.x PATCH CR-1 for the location-only fix. The 979s→365s e2e on the 2141-page vault came from retry/backoff only; the (dormant) halving contributed zero. The 151s additional gain over Batch 2 came from Layers 1-3 of the Batch 6 fallback going live (see Added).
- **`Map<string, true>` → `Set<string>` on `ReasoningStripProber.cache` (PR #411 simplify).** Removed the dead `=== true` check on every read and the dead `invalidate(baseUrl?)` overload (zero production callers — only tests used it).

### Tests

- **2928 tests / 213 files passing.** +13 net since v1.25.11:
  - +7 `__tests__/tools/llm-wiki-cli/main.test.ts` (parseCliOptions base contract + boundary-catch USAGE contract, dispatchCli shapes, `--thinking-mode` enum + legacy deprecation + ambiguity, `--round-base` + legacy deprecation, numeric validation (safe-integer, empty-value rejection, `=`-form negatives), boolean plumbing incl. `--extract-only` ⇒ `--dry-run`, applyOverrides (prototype-key guard, single-field patches), resolveApiKey OS guidance, applyThinkingMode, parseNumber)
  - +3 `__tests__/root/constants.test.ts` (new threshold constants)
  - +11 `__tests__/root/i18n-parity.test.ts` (Russian locale wiring + 11-way README switcher)
  - +11 `__tests__/wiki/lint/duplicate-detection.test.ts` (threshold override tests)
  - +3 `__tests__/wiki/lint/llm-phases/dedup-phase.test.ts` (classifyTiers threshold tests)
  - +3 `__tests__/llm-sdk/reasoning-strip-probe.test.ts` (two-marker classifier + Set conversion)
  - +1 `__tests__/llm-sdk/openai-compat-request-body.test.ts` (wire-body regression: `reasoning_effort: 'none'` IS on the body, not just on the `providerOptions` argument handed to the SDK)
  - +3 `__tests__/core/rate-limit.test.ts` (CR-3 wiring + structured-form + discriminator)
  - +4 `__tests__/types/settings.test.ts` (new threshold settings defaults)
  - +1 `__tests__/wiki/lint/fill-empty-page-created.test.ts` (#388 regression guard: `created:` from caller, not content)
  - +1 `__tests__/wiki/lint/merge-duplicates-link-retarget.test.ts` (#386 regression guard)
  - +2 `__tests__/core/folder-scope.test.ts` (PR #389 new primitives `isAtOrInFolderScope` + `isExcludedFromSourcePicker`)
  - +1 `__tests__/core/source-lemma.test.ts` (PR #357 source-slug deterministic merge)
  - +2 `__tests__/wiki/source-analyzer-thinking.test.ts` (Batch 6 per-call thinkingPolicy regression guard: repair callback does NOT pass `enableThinking: false`)
  - +1 `__tests__/wiki/source-analyzer-lemma-guarantee.test.ts` (PR #357 invariant)
  - −2 net deletions (removed 2 stale `lint-analysis-cache.test.ts` + `lint-smart-skip.test.ts` from PR #406 dead-code cleanup; replaced 1 stale `duplicate-detection.test.ts` shadow file from the lint sub-package)

### Internal

- Subcommand dispatch via `dispatchCli(argv)` returning a tagged union `{ kind: 'tool-help' | 'ingest' | 'unknown' }`. Adding a future `lint` or `query` subcommand is one `case` and the compiler will refuse to forget it. Flag-shaped first arguments (e.g. forgetting `ingest`) surface a hint rather than getting swallowed.
- Numeric validation collapsed into a single `parseNumber(raw, flag, predicate)` helper driven by a spec table in `parseCliOptions()`, so errors surface from the parser (with the ingest USAGE block attached) instead of mid-run. A single boundary catch appends `INGEST_USAGE` to every escaping error, detecting by a stable marker substring (the exact `run-llm-wiki.mjs ingest` path) rather than matching on message text.
- `--help` is now a pure marker (`options.help: boolean`) instead of calling `process.exit(0)` inside the parser, so `parseCliOptions` is testable. The `runIngest` runner handles the actual printing.
- Code-review hardening (8 angles, subagents, both CLI and #383 follow-up): prototype-key guard on the settings-derived granularity path in `applyOverrides`, empty/whitespace numeric rejection (`Number('')` coerced to 0 — `--max-tokens-per-call ""` silently meant "no cap"), `--model` trim, `Number.isSafeInteger` for integer flags, `-h` alias at the ingest subcommand, `--vault` ENOENT → friendly message, deprecation throws before required-flag checks, folder-scope centralisation closing the same unanchored-prefix leak class on the configDir half. All backward-compatible.
- Root `tsconfig.json` gains `exclude: ["src/__tests__/tools/**"]` because the CLI test files import `tools/` source via relative paths and root tsc would otherwise follow those imports into `@types/node@16` territory (`parseArgs` was added in Node 18.3+). vitest still finds them via its own include glob.
- `src/core/folder-scope.ts` adds two new primitives alongside `isInFolderScope`: `isAtOrInFolderScope(path, folder, isRoot)` (true for the folder itself OR any descendant — fixes the #383 picker leak in one rule) and `isExcludedFromSourcePicker(path, wikiFolder, configDir)` (the centralised picker rule used by all three pickers).
- `src/core/source-lemma.ts` exposes `isSourceOwnPageLemma` + `selectSourceLemma` (PR #357 source-slug = page-lemma deterministic merge); `src/core/sources-normalizer.ts` exposes `normalizeSourcesInFolder` (PR #389 module-function pattern).
- `src/llm-sdk/reasoning-strip-probe.ts` (Batch 6, PR #411) — `ReasoningStripProber` per-baseURL cache + `isReasoningFieldError` two-marker classifier (mirrors `isPdfRelatedLlmError` design in `src/wiki/wiki-engine.ts:587-608`).
- `src/wiki/lint/duplicate-detection.ts` adds `DuplicateDetectionThresholds` options-object + per-call `tier1Cutoff` parameter on `classifyTiers` (PR #395 + PR #410 thread-through).
- `src/ui/settings-sections/advanced-settings-section.ts` is the new bottom Advanced settings panel (PR #395); hosts the 3 dedup threshold inputs + `lintDedupIncludeSources`. Separate from the LLM Advanced section (which retains `temperature`, `repetitionPenalty`, `forcePdfSupport`).
- `src/ui/settings-sections/shared-inputs.ts` adds `renderNumberInput` (consolidated from prior `renderNumericInput` + `renderDedupThresholdInput`); regression test in `settings-section-helpers.test.ts`.
- `src/constants.ts` gains 5 new constants: `LINT_DEDUP_BUCKET_COUNT`, `LINT_DEDUP_BUCKET_PREFIX_LEN`, `LINT_DEDUP_JACCARD_LINK_THRESHOLD`, `LINT_DEDUP_JACCARD_BODY_GATE`, `LINT_DEDUP_BIGRAM_THRESHOLD`. `LINT_DEDUP_BIGRAM_TIER1_CUTOFF` (Batch 2) — constant-only, intentionally NOT exposed to Settings.
- `package.json` `bin` field exposes `llm-wiki`; `scripts.llm-wiki` mirrors `node tools/llm-wiki-cli/run-llm-wiki.mjs`.
- `tools/llm-wiki-cli/tsconfig.json` (PR #372) — separate tsconfig for the CLI with `@types/node@22`; root tsconfig excludes `src/__tests__/tools/**` to keep the `parseArgs` import below `node_modules/@types/node@16` from poisoning root tsc.
- `versions.json` gains `1.26.0: 1.11.4` entry.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-07-18

**Theme:** Cache-only PDF Ingest (Level 1) with provider gate + content-hash cache + bounded growth; prompt centralization for the PDF transcriber; status-bar cancellation via Vercel AI SDK v6 AbortSignal; local model guidance with Apple Silicon OCR path (oMLX + Markitdown + Baidu Unlimited-OCR). 2182 tests passing (165 files). Recommended upgrade for everyone on v1.24.x.

### Added

- **PDF Ingest (Level 1).** Pick a PDF from your vault — the plugin reads it through your LLM provider's native file input (anthropic / openai / bedrock-anthropic / bedrock-openai natively; any other OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint via **Force PDF Support** in Settings → LLM Configuration → Advanced), converts it to Markdown via an OCR-style verbatim transcriber prompt with `[illegible]` / `[figure: ...]` / `[equation: ...]` anti-hallucination markers, and re-enters the regular Markdown ingest pipeline. Every existing entity / concept / alias / `[[wiki-link]]` workflow applies unchanged. The result is **content-hash cached** in `.obsidian/plugins/karpathywiki/pdf-cache/`; the cache key embeds `converterVersion` so prompt upgrades invalidate stale entries automatically.
- **Bounded cache growth.** Three-defense-layer cache housekeeping: single-entry cap (10 MB) pre-write, LRU-by-mtime eviction (100 MB total / 1000 entries) post-write, and `prepareBatchIngest()` (TTL purge + size enforce) wired into `runBatchIngest()` via `preparePdfCacheForBatchIngest()`. Cache only by default — your vault is not modified.
- **Optional vault sidecar.** Settings → Wiki Configuration → Wiki Folder → **Write PDF Markdown to Vault** writes a `<basename>.pdf.md` sidecar next to the source PDF after conversion. Off by default (cache-only). This is the only user-visible opt-in that touches the vault.
- **Universal Force PDF Support escape hatch.** Any non-native provider (custom, anthropic-compatible, ollama, lmstudio, deepseek, kimi, glm, etc.) can attempt PDF conversion when the toggle is on. The endpoint decides; failures surface as a localized `sourceRejectedPdfUnsupported` Notice guiding the user to disable the toggle or switch provider. The trust boundary is the user — your endpoint either accepts PDF or it doesn't; the toggle tells us to ask it. Switching the provider to a NATIVE one (anthropic / openai / bedrock-*) auto-resets the toggle to `false`.
- **Local PDF OCR path on Apple Silicon.** Documented end-to-end recommended setup for fully-local PDF ingestion: [oMLX](https://github.com/jundot/omlx) + Markitdown backend + Baidu Unlimited-OCR (open-sourced 2026-06-22, 3B total / 0.5B active, end-to-end OCR that solves the "slower the longer it generates" failure mode of older OCR models on long documents). Provider: **Custom OpenAI-Compatible** pointing at oMLX's local server with Force PDF Support on. PDF never leaves the machine.
- **Cancellable PDF ingest.** Clicking the status bar mid-conversion aborts the in-flight LLM call through Vercel AI SDK v6 AbortSignal in ~200 ms. Both `.catch` handlers (`selectSourceToIngest` and `ingestActiveFile`) now call `dismissProgress()` so the persistent "Ingesting: <basename>" Notice clears on throw.
- **Local model recommendations.** Dedicated `### 🦙 Local Model Recommendations (Ollama / LM Studio)` H3 in the Model Selection Guide, covering Qwen3.5 (27B / 35B-A3B / 122B-A10B), Qwen3.6 (27B with 256K+ context / 35B-A3B), Gemma 4 (E2B / E4B / 26B-A4B / 31B), with parameter-vs-quality tradeoff guidance, MLX-vs-GGUF quantization notes, and a context-strategy block. **All 10 locales.**
- **New Cloud Model Picks H3** in the Model Selection Guide, separating the cloud-vs-local sections explicitly. **All 10 locales.**
- **PDF transcriber prompt centralized.** `src/wiki/prompts/pdf.ts` houses `PDF_CONVERSION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (rewritten as OCR-style verbatim transcriber) plus `unwrapFencedMarkdown()` cleanup helper (strips ` ```markdown ` / ` ``` ` / `<output>` wrappers that small/local models still produce despite instructions). Re-exported via the existing `src/prompts.ts` barrel — PDF was the last LLM-call site to be folded into the project's prompt barrel.
- **PDF error classifier (`isPdfRelatedLlmError`).** Routes obvious PDF-rejection errors (rejection verb + PDF/media marker) to a localized `sourceRejectedPdfUnsupported` Notice. Tightened after the initial implementation: requires BOTH a rejection verb (`reject` / `not support` / `unsupported` / `invalid` / `not allowed`) AND a PDF/media marker (`pdf` / `application/pdf` / `file part` / `mediatype`). Pre-fix classifier substring-matched on `'pdf'` alone, causing transient 413 size-limit errors and Rust-serde "unknown variant `file`" schema rejects (no `pdf` keyword) to be misreported.
- **Three-defense-layer cache filename safety.** Physical filename on disk is `sha256(logicalKey).slice(0, 16)` (Git short-hash style); the logical key retains `sha256:model:converterVersion` semantics; the converter hashes via new `hashCacheKey()` helper before `cache.get/set`. Fixes Windows `ERROR_INVALID_NAME` + POSIX unintended subpath when model contains `/` or `:`.
- **PDF cache directory auto-creation.** `PdfConversionCache.ensureCacheDir()` walks path segments before `mkdir`. Obsidian's adapter does NOT auto-create parent directories, which left cache writes silently failing in fresh vaults.

### Changed

- **Default behavior preserved.** No breaking changes since v1.0.0. Old `data.json` without the new settings fields defaults to `false`, preserving cache-only behavior. The previously-planned sidecar-by-default approach was withdrawn in favor of cache-only before v1.25.0 ships (architecture pivot documented in `project_v1.25.0_pdf_cache_only`).
- **PDF dispatch lives in `wiki-engine.ts`.** The separate `pdf-ingest-orchestrator.ts` file was deleted; `ingestPdfSource` now feeds `convertPdfToMarkdown` result into `analyzeSource` via `IngestOptions.contentOverride`, reusing the existing Markdown ingest pipeline.
- **5 dead i18n keys removed** across all 10 locales (old "PDF orchestrator" + sidecar-default language).
- **`LLMClient.createMessage` gained `abortSignal?: AbortSignal`** as an optional parameter. Existing client implementations ignore unknown params (graceful degradation); the project ships a passing thread.

### Fixed

- **ENOENT cache dir (Bug A).** Obsidian adapter doesn't auto-create parent directories. `ensureCacheDir()` walks segments before mkdir.
- **AI-SDK cause chain (Bug B).** Vercel AI SDK v6 wraps provider rejections inside `error.cause.message`. The pre-fix `isPdfRelatedLlmError` classifier inspected only `error.message` and missed the rejection phrase. `inspectCauseChain()` walks the cause chain up to 4 levels with cycle protection; classifiers consult both layers. Now also extended to detect Rust-serde schema rejects ("unknown variant `file`, expected `text`") which lack any `pdf` keyword.
- **Stuck "Ingesting: <basename>" Notice (Bug H).** When an interactive single-file ingest threw (network / vault IO / unexpected error), the persistent progress Notice stayed on screen until the next ingest. Both `.catch` blocks (`selectSourceToIngest` line 645, `ingestActiveFile` line 671) now call `this.dismissProgress()` after showing the error Notice.
- **Status bar didn't mirror Notice (Bug C).** Clicking the status bar during PDF conversion didn't update text — fixed via double-callback pattern (Notice channel + text mirror in `onProgress` closure).
- **PDF mid-flow cancel ineffective (Bug D).** Two-layered bug: setup block re-initialized on re-entry overwrote AbortController, AND `convertPdfToMarkdown` didn't thread AbortSignal to the LLM call. Fixed with idempotency guard in `wiki-engine.ingestSource` (`if (this.abortController === null)`) + abortSignal threading through `PdfConversionContext`.
- **pdf-cache never written (Bug E).** Same root cause as Bug A but in the cache write path. `ensureCacheDir()` fix covers both directions.
- **Classifier false-positive guards (PR3 follow-up #3).** 6 new tests pin the contract — 2 happy-path (route to skip) + 4 false-positive guards (413 / 5xx / null-deref / generic-invalid → re-throw).
- **Markdown wrapper contamination in PDF output.** Some local / small models (Qwen3.5-2B-MLX-4bit, Llama 3 8B Instruct, etc.) wrap their PDF-conversion response in ```markdown ... ``` fences despite the system prompt forbidding them. `unwrapFencedMarkdown()` heuristic cleaner strips BOM → outermost ` ```markdown ` → outermost ` ``` ` → `<output>` → leading "Here is the converted Markdown:" preamble. Internal ```python ... ``` blocks survive (regex is single-fence, outermost-only).

### Tests

- 2182 tests passing (165 files). +102 tests since v1.24.1.

  - 30+ PDF ingest end-to-end tests (provider gate, cache hit/miss, settings defaults, sidecar create/update, forcePdfSupport toggle, classifier, cause chain walking, status bar, cancel-mid-PDF)
  - 20 prompt invariant + unwrap helper tests (`src/__tests__/wiki/prompts/pdf.test.ts`)
  - 6 PDF error classifier regression tests (happy-path + 413/5xx/null-deref/generic-invalid guards)
  - 3 Bug D lifecycle tests (idempotency guard, AbortSignal propagation, dismiss on throw)

### Aggregate scope

- **5-stage PPR seed-selection cascade (PR #281).** Query Wiki now composes context through five complementary stages before generation: (1) lex fast path over entity/concept titles and aliases; (2) LLM keyword generation for synonyms, abbreviations, and token-overlap-resistant terms; (3) local substring scan of generated keywords across titles, aliases, and body snippets; (4) LLM KB fallback that re-seeds top-N candidates semantically when earlier stages are weak; (5) Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala 2002) over the `[[wiki-link]]` graph starting from the seed set. The cascade auto-truncates at the stage that returns enough signal — no fixed 5-step cost, no LLM calls when lex suffices. Benchmark: PPR @5 = 27.1% vs pure knn baseline 24.1%, zero embedding opt-in.
- **Bedrock Stage 1 providers (PR #277/280).** Added `bedrock-anthropic` and `bedrock-openai` provider options routed through the AWS `bedrock-mantle.<region>.api.aws` endpoint. Region selector defaults to `us-east-1`. Zero new npm deps; bundle delta ~+3 KB. Stage 2/3 (bearer-only `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock`, SSO/profile) remain deferred pending demand.
- **Page-factory split (PR #276).** Split `src/wiki/page-factory.ts` (1252 LOC) into 10 focused modules (`aliases.ts`, `complementary-appends.ts`, `contextualize.ts`, `create-page.ts`, `index.ts`, `mentions-integration.ts`, `merge-page.ts`, `merge-triage.ts`, `path-resolution.ts`, `related-page.ts`) with 99 new dedicated unit-test files.
- **Consolidated the two "reviewed" protection mechanisms (#244 follow-up, PR #283).** Removed the body-level HTML-comment marker (v1.24.0) that protected only a page's `## Mentions in Source` section. Protection is now driven solely by frontmatter `reviewed: true` via the minimal-append path.
- **Non-lossy Mentions re-ingest (#267, PR #269/272).** `assembleFinalContent` previously dropped every earlier source's accumulated mentions (regression from #244). Merge now parses the existing page's mentions and unions them with the new source's (composite `(quote, source_path)` dedup key) before injecting; fail-safe preserves hand-edited section verbatim.
- **Empty-response quiet path (PR #282).** `parseJsonResponse` gained `silentOnEmpty` / `throwOnEmpty` options. Lint batch callers suppress noisy console errors for empty LLM bodies. Seed selector throws `EmptyResponseError` on empty body as defense-in-depth.
- **LM Studio no-key ingest (PR #269/272).** `initializeLLMClient`, `llmReady`, `testLLMConnection` treat LM Studio like Ollama for the API-key gate.
- **Settings unified↔per-task cascade (post-#281 e2e).** Three edge cases where toggling Model Scope could leave `tempSettings` and `settings` out of sync — fixed.
- **`load-pages` `.md` suffix defense (post-#281 e2e).** Normalized path handling so wiki-page paths with or without `.md` suffix resolve consistently.
- **Streaming-chunk debug cleanup (post-#281 e2e).** Removed stray `console.debug` in `openai-compat-sdk-client.ts` streaming path.
- **Tier C welcome-note recreate bypass (PR #271).** `recreateWelcomeNote` and `ensureWelcomeNote` accept `forceRecreate: true`.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-07-10

**Theme:** Per-task model routing, custom query instructions, four monolith splits, source-note aliases, frontmatter write repair. 1825 tests passing. Recommended upgrade for everyone on v1.23.x.

### Added

- **Per-task Models (#208).** Three independent settings (`ingestModel`, `lintModel`, `queryModel`) on top of the existing `model`. Switch via *Settings → Wiki → Model Scope* dropdown: **Unified** (one model for all tasks) or **Per-Task** (independent choice per ingest / lint / query). Empty per-task field falls back to `settings.model`, so existing v1.23.x data.json continues to work bit-identically. New `core/model-resolver.ts` (`resolveModelForTask(settings, task)`) is the single decision point used by all 28 LLM call sites; `ui/settings-per-task-helpers.ts` owns the UI-scope logic (mode resolution, displayed-model computation, preserve-on-toggle). Each picker uses a sentinel `__custom__` ("Custom input…") — leaving the text input blank means "use unified model", matching the original picker behavior.
- **Test Connection multi-probe (#208).** When `usePerTaskModels === true`, the **Test Connection** button now probes each configured model sequentially (ingest → lint → query) with fail-fast — until every per-task model passes, the connection is considered unhealthy. Console logs include `[testLLMConnection] probe plan: ingest=…, lint=…, query=…` for verification.
- **Custom Query Instructions (#251, `jameses-cyber`).** Collapsible `<details>` panel inside the Query Wiki view, between the prompt and the history list. Appends user-supplied instructions to the system prompt at the three Query Wiki send sites (streaming, non-stream fallback, non-stream main). 5000-character defensive cap (centralised `CUSTOM_QUERY_INSTRUCTIONS_MAX_CHARS`). Strictly scoped to Query Wiki chat — ingest, lint, page generation, save-to-wiki evaluation, duplicate merge, and seed selection are intentionally unaffected. Persisted as `customQueryInstructions?: string` in data.json. Modes dropdown (Default / Research / Exact Facts / Commitments) + per-conversation override planned for v1.25.0+. Initial UI review used *Settings → Query Wiki*; shipped UI is the Query-local panel per user review.
- **First-query PPR warmup.** Engine-level `_cachedGraph` (`WikiEngine.getOrBuildGraph(allPaths)`) loaded once on first query, invalidates on `wikiFolder` change or `invalidatePageCaches`. First query now uses Personalized PageRank instead of falling back to lex-only on cold start. `QueryView.invalidateGraph()` delegates to the engine.
- **`fundingUrl` in manifest.** Adds `"fundingUrl": "https://ko-fi.com/greenerdalii"` to `manifest.json` per [Obsidian manifest spec](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/Manifest#fundingUrl). Optional field; Obsidian-side display depends on Community Plugin UI surfacing.

### Changed

- **`modals.ts` 1008-LOC split into directory (PR #257, `4b65450`).** `src/ui/modals.ts` → `src/ui/modals/` with 7 focused files. External API unchanged (barrel `index.ts` re-exports). Required after the v1.23.0 P2 modals feature set pushed the file past the 1000-LOC threshold.
- **`controller.ts` `runLintWiki` god function split into 3 phase modules (PR #248, `ef44a58`).** `src/wiki/lint/controller.ts:runLintWiki` (was a monolithic 200+ LOC function) decomposed into Phases A/B/C (`src/wiki/lint/llm-phases/analysis-phase.ts`, `src/wiki/lint/llm-phases/scoring-phase.ts`, `src/wiki/lint/llm-phases/synthesis-phase.ts`). The orchestrator now delegates: analysis → scoring → synthesis.
- **`history-modal.ts` 1579-LOC single file split into directory (PR #249, `fe273a4`).** `src/ui/history-modal.ts` → `src/ui/history-modal/` with 14 files (~250 LOC each max): `types.ts`, `render-state.ts`, `HistoryModal-class.ts`, 9 renderer modules under `src/ui/history-modal/renderers/`, and an `index.ts` re-export shim. External API (`HistoryModal` class, `TEXTS`-based `HistoryTexts`) unchanged. Zero caller-side changes required. 1610 tests passing.
- **`query-engine.ts` 1373-LOC monolith split into directory (PR #250, `3ff0cc6`).** `src/wiki/query-engine.ts` → 15 focused modules under `src/wiki/query-engine/`. `QueryView.buildWikiContext` (was 165 LOC inline) decomposes into 4 pure pipeline phases (`read-index`, `load-pages`, `assemble-context`, `seed-selector`). External API (`QueryView`, `VIEW_TYPE_QUERY`, `renderThinkingBlocksUI`) unchanged via TypeScript directory resolution. 1616 tests passing.
- **28 LLM call sites wired through `resolveModelForTask` (#208, `e96568e`).** Sourced via *Sliced change-by-change* across 11 production files: ingest (14 — `source-analyzer`, `page-factory` × 7, `conversation-ingest` × 4, `wiki-engine.createSummaryPage`, `schema-manager`, `auto-maintain` × 2), lint (9 — `analysis-phase`, `dedup-phase`, `fill-empty-page`, `fix-dead-link` × 2, `fix-runners` × 2, `link-orphan`, `merge-duplicates`, `contradictions`), query (5 — `QueryView` × 3 send sites + `save-eval`, `seed-selector`). Five `settings.model` direct reads intentionally preserved: Test Connection probe plan, 2 log metadata, console.debug, empty-model pre-flight. E2E observability: 6 `console.debug` lines show the resolved model at each major call site.
- **Source-note aliases propagation (#185, `c0f0bc0`).** Frontmatter `aliases:` from source notes now propagates into generated `sources/<slug>` page frontmatter, so downstream `[[wiki-link]]` matching and alias-aware search reach every quote. Reduces "DSA ≠ DeepSeek-Sparse-Attention" type misses on cross-language aliases.
- **Tier-1 + Tier-2 merge triage (#216, `b7bf5f0`, `DocTpoint`).** Classify-then-route duplicate-bypass decision: spurious Tier-1 candidates are skipped outright; Tier-2 runs only on the remainder. Reduces Lint merge batch size without sacrificing high-precision matches.

### Fixed

- **Frontmatter write repair (4 user-reported bugs, `1d943ea`).** `aliases:[]` no longer falsely passes the alias-deficiency lint check; duplicate aliases are collapsed on write via the new `replaceFrontmatterArrayField` helper; block-style frontmatter is preserved (no longer flattened to inline) via the new `mergeFrontmatterArrayField` helper; write failures are now logged with the offending field name. Affects Smart Fix and merge paths.
- **Empty-line / trailing-blank-line fix for `## 相关实体` / `## 相关概念` sections (PR #260, `9793efd`).** Tier-2 per-section append normalized to use a single blank-line separator; previously produced double-blank or zero-blank depending on the input.
- **`wikiFolder` change propagation (`1d943ea`, `8d5baf3`).** `saveSettings` now invalidates the QueryView graph cache and WikiEngine pagesCache when `wikiFolder` changes; `updateSettings` drops the path-keyed caches on `wikiFolder` change. Stale history migration Notice explains that pre-v1.24.0 query history keeps its old folder paths (clearing history remains the escape hatch).
- **Retrieval label human-readable + persistence (#221 follow-up, `b46f7b1` / `81813ae`).** Retrieval-label text now reads "Found N page(s)" instead of the internal cache key; label is persisted across view re-open.

### Maintenance

- 1825 tests passing (132 test files). 81 tests added during the v1.24.0 cycle.
- 5 new i18n keys × 10 locales for the per-task model pickers + Model Scope dropdown + Test Connection labels.
- 8 new i18n keys × 10 locales for the Custom Query Instructions collapsible panel.



## [1.23.x PATCH series] - 2026-07-02 → 2026-07-05

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** v1.23.2 (single PATCH) over 3 days. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.23.0..1.23.2`.

### Aggregate scope

- **Semantic progress notification module (#219).** New `core/progress-notification.ts` with `decideProgressDisplay(scope, isLong, hasUserAction)`. Manual operations show Notice + status bar; background operations (watch-mode auto-ingest, periodic lint, startup QuickFixes) show status bar only. Channel selection is derived from operation semantics — no user-facing setting.
- **Query turn indicator (#221).** Right-edge vertical dots, one per conversation turn. IntersectionObserver highlights the currently visible turn; clicking scrolls that turn's question to the top via `scrollIntoView({ block: 'start' })`. Hover reveals the original question text in a tooltip.
- **Retrieval label click-to-expand.** The `🔍 N page(s) · …` label below each assistant response is clickable — clicking toggles an inline panel listing the retrieved pages.
- **Section header canonicalizer (DocTpoint, PR #241).** `core/section-header-canonicalizer.ts` uses bounded Levenshtein distance to snap LLM-garbled section headers (e.g. `Erwägungen…` → `Erwähnungen in der Quelle`) back to canonical labels on write. Eliminates silent drop from Tier-B retrieval in `wikiLanguage: de` clean re-ingest runs.
- **Dynamic lint/fix status bar.** `wikiEngine.updateStatusBar()` is wired to the real Obsidian status bar element. Fix-runners' per-file progress messages (e.g. `[3/10] fixing: file.md`) reach the status bar during manual lint, watch-mode auto-ingest, and Smart Fix All.
- **`wrapWithAdvancedSettings` refactor.** Replaced `.bind()` + in-place mutation with composition (`Object.create(client)` + explicit `createMessage` override). Preserves prototype chain — class-based SDK clients no longer fall back to non-streaming because spread `{ ...client }` dropped `createMessageStream`.
- **`buildPagesListForPrompt` sources-filter (#234).** Adds `{ excludeSources: true }` default option. The LLM candidate list no longer includes `wiki/sources/` pages.
- **Frontmatter serializer consolidation (DocTpoint, PR #238).** `mergeFrontmatter` / `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` / `mergeDuplicatePages` delegate to a single `serializeFrontmatter` writer.
- **Lint completion Notices respect TTLs.** All `run*Fixes` completion Notices and `lintWikiFailed` use `NOTICE_NORMAL` (5s) / `NOTICE_ERROR` (8s) instead of `new Notice(msg, 0)`.
- **License upgrade to Apache 2.0 + DCO.** NOTICE file lists all 6 human code contributors alphabetically. CONTRIBUTING.md includes a License & DCO section. Future commits require `Signed-off-by:`.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-07-02

**Theme:** Replace the brittle hand-rolled LLM client (v1.22.x 1625-LOC `llm-client.ts` with 30+ provider-version workarounds accumulated since v1.20.0) with Vercel AI-SDK v6, then ship the Graph Engine PPR primitive on top. Biggest architectural change since 1.0.

**Branch state:** `refactor/v1.23.0-ai-sdk-migration` (38 commits ahead of main, **1376 tests passing**, 3.17 MB bundle). Folds in the v1.22.6 hotfix series and P2-4 PPR tuning.

### Added

- **Vercel AI-SDK v6 migration (P1-7).** Replaced hand-rolled `OpenAICompatibleClient` / `AnthropicClient` / `AnthropicCompatibleClient` (1625 LOC) with `@ai-sdk/openai@3` / `@ai-sdk/anthropic@3` / `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@2` / `ai@6`. New `src/llm-sdk/` (5 files, 1421 LOC: `openai-sdk-client.ts` 455 LOC, `anthropic-sdk-client.ts` 300 LOC, `openai-compat-sdk-client.ts` 449 LOC, `token-key-probe.ts` 70 LOC, `create-llm-client.ts` 151 LOC). `src/core/obsidian-fetch-bridge.ts` (326 LOC) provides activeDocument-aware fetch for jsdom. Deleted 8 old test files (2609 LOC). **Eliminates the entire class of provider-version regressions** (#137 / #141 / #143 / #147 / #207).
- **Graph Engine (Issue #198).** Personalized PageRank over `[[wiki-link]]` graph — closes #117 (Query Wiki relevance), #157 (hub detection), #175 (link distinctiveness) with one primitive. `core/monte-carlo-ppr.ts` (Fogaras 2005 MC-PPR, 99 LOC) performs K short random walks per query page at O(K×L) cost independent of |V|. `core/ppr-cascade.ts` (213 LOC) orchestrates three-tier pipeline (lex fast path → LLM seeds → PPR walks). `core/section-extractor.ts` (Tier B zero-LLM, 173 LOC). `core/hub-detection.ts` (134 LOC). `core/build-graph.ts` (wiki-link graph builder, 13 unit tests).
- **Query Wiki three-tier pipeline (P1-5).** Lex fast path → LLM seed selection (only when fast path is weak) → PPR walks. Reduces 99% of LLM seed-selection cost.
- **Hub-link distinctiveness scanner (P1-6, Issue #157 / #175).** New lint pass that flags pages whose outgoing links mostly point to low-distinctiveness hubs. 229 LOC + 15 tests. Contributed by @DocTpoint.
- **Hub-retirement crystallization signal (PR #215, @DocTpoint).** `core/hub-retirement.ts` (175 LOC + 12 unit tests + 136 LOC integration tests). Pure percentile-based verdict with dual absolute guards.
- **Unified URL fallback for custom baseURLs.** `core/url-fallback.ts` (395 LOC) auto-resolves missing `/v1` in user-entered baseURLs (Kimi Coding Plan, GLM, z.ai). Module-level static cache survives `createLLMClient` re-creation so Ingest / Lint / Query all benefit.
- **Token-key probe-then-retry (KISS, no regex).** `src/llm-sdk/token-key-probe.ts` (70 LOC) caches working `max_tokens` ↔ `max_completion_tokens` key per baseURL on first failure. Triggered by `if (statusCode === 400 && !cached) → retry`. Addresses root cause of #207 for all OpenAI-compatible gateways.
- **Real-time streaming for all providers (P2).** `result.textStream` true逐块 streaming now works in all three `llm-sdk` clients. macrotask yield between chunks forces a paint frame per chunk (no more batch-arrival UX). Resolves user Q1 feedback.
- **Welcome note (Phase 5.1.5).** Three-tier first-run Welcome note (Tier A empty / Tier B existing / Tier C upgrade). `type: welcome` frontmatter, `createWelcomeNote` toggle, `Recreate Welcome Note` command. D8 LLM dynamic translation writes the note in the user's wiki language at write time — no hardcoded i18n.
- **Multi-File Ingest (Issue #130).** Two-pane picker: left = recursive folder tree with per-file checkboxes, right = live ingest queue with status. "Add to queue" two-step flow, per-file cancel, "Cancel all" for pending/running jobs. Reuses `runBatchIngest` so the per-file loop, dedup, and report modal are shared with folder ingest. New `IngestQueue` pub/sub store is the single source of truth for in-session ingest lifecycle.
- **LM Studio API-key gate (Issue #223).** `main.ts:962` now excludes both `ollama` and `lmstudio` from API-key validation. Local providers can test connection without an API key.
- **knn baseline analysis (P2-3 eval acceptance gate).** DocTpoint ran a knn baseline (bge-m3, no graph) on the same `sample-50page` fixture per #198 follow-up: cascade R@5 27.1% vs knn 24.1% (3pp gap). Reinforces 2026-06-22 #175 rejection — embeddings permanently rejected.
- **i18n settings rewrite (10 locales).** User-first language throughout ("disable thinking") instead of implementation details ("3-tier dialect fallback chain"). 14 new keys per locale for Welcome note + Ingest modal UI.
- **Sponsor section.** Ko-fi button + 💖 Support the Project section in all 10 READMEs. https://ko-fi.com/greenerdalii.
- **P2-4 PPR tuning.** Real vault (2142 pages) tuning across 6 iterations. Recommended parameters `damping=0.05, numWalks=3000, walkLength=20` improve R@5 from 21.5% → 23.8% (+11% relative). See `src/__tests__/fixtures/wikis/sample-50page/REAL_VAULT_EVAL.md`.

### Changed

- **Provider error body now reaches Test Connection UI.** `window.fetch` re-fetch with 5s timeout captures the provider's diagnostic into the Notice. Replaces generic `status 400` with e.g. `"status 429: You exceeded your current quota"`.
- **Lint performance knobs centralised in `src/constants.ts`.** Single-file tuning instead of 4-file drift across `controller.ts` / `duplicate-detection.ts` / `preparation.ts` / `batch-limits.ts`.
- **429/5xx exponential backoff on Responses API path.** Both Chat Completions and Responses API paths now share the same `withRetry` (3 attempts, 1s/2s/4s + jitter).
- **`thinkingControlCache` deprecated.** Removed the 3-tier dialect probe; AI-SDK handles thinking internally. Cache retained on disk for backward-compat (will be removed in v1.24.0 if no use case surfaces).
- **Real-time streaming UX.** Cascade + LLM seed retrieval improvements: reduced tokens per cascade round, tightened seed-selection prompt.
- **Welcome note refactor.** Moved LLM config status from in-body text to frontmatter (hidden metadata). Local-check in Welcome note orchestrator (no LLM if config already valid).

### Fixed

- **#207 — GPT-5.x models no longer fail Test Connection with 400.** Full coverage including `-pro` variants (v1.22.5 / v1.22.6 hotfixes).
- **#204 — Auto Ingest no longer opens blocking modal.** `trigger='auto'|'manual'` field on `IngestReport` / `IngestOptions` routes auto-ingest completion to `onAutoIngestDone` (Notice) instead of `IngestReportModal`.
- **#204 — Auto Smart Fix completion is context-aware.** Same `trigger` pattern routes `AutoMaintainManager.schedulePeriodicLint` completion differently based on `autoSmartFix` setting.
- **#223 — LM Studio Test Connection no longer requires API key.** Local providers excluded from the API-key gate.
- **`generation_complete` no longer stamped onto `log.md` / `index.md` / `schema/`** (v1.22.3, carried forward). `isInWikiContentFolder()` guard restricts the stamp to `wiki/{entities,concepts,sources}/...`.
- **Real-time streaming was batched.** Fixed via macrotask yield + `result.textStream`-only consumption (not `fullStream` then `textStream`, which buffered all events).

### Tests

- **1376 tests passing** across 100 files (+272 since v1.22.0).

### Risk Register

- Bundle size 1.24 MB → 3.17 MB (user accepted 2026-06-29). Obsidian manifest has no size limit; lazy `await import()` for AI-SDK packages didn't reduce bundle (esbuild CJS inline); future ESM bundle / dynamic chunk can revisit.
- #207 close decision: user will close manually after real-world testing — separate commit `Closes #207`, not part of v1.23.0.
- #213 (configurable page categories): Discussion-only, NOT confirmed for any minor release per user instruction 2026-06-30. Requires broader community/architectural discussion.

## [1.22.x PATCH series] - 2026-06-23 → 2026-06-30

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec + CLAUDE.md "ancient versions are pre-aggregated".** 6 PATCH releases (v1.22.1 → v1.22.6) over 7 days. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.22.0..1.22.6` and memory files.

### Aggregate scope

- **#204 — Auto-ingest modal suppression:** v1.22.2 split `onIngestDone` → `onAutoIngestDone` with `autoIngestNotificationLevel: 'notice' | 'modal'` setting; v1.22.6 wires `trigger: 'auto' | 'manual'` through `IngestReport` so watch-mode ingests skip the blocking `IngestReportModal`. Same `trigger` pattern applied to `runLintWiki` for auto vs manual completion dispatch.
- **`log.md` header language-agnosticism:** v1.22.3 replaced text-based detection with structural `<!-- llm-wiki-log-header-start -->` marker + moved all 10 locale header strings into `src/texts/<lang>.ts`; auto-migration via `isOldFormatLogHeader()` / `migrateLogHeader()`.
- **`generation_complete` stamp scope narrowed:** v1.22.3 added `isInWikiContentFolder()` guard so the stamp no longer pollutes `log.md` / `index.md` / `schema/` files on every QuickFix run.
- **`periodicLint` cadence refined:** v1.22.2 removed "Hourly" (unrealistic for LLM-based lint), added "Monthly"; auto-migrate `hourly` saves to `daily` on next plugin load.
- **#207 — GPT-5.x OpenAI Responses API routing:** v1.22.4 introduced `max_tokens` ↔ `max_completion_tokens` runtime probe-then-cache + provider error body enrichment; v1.22.5 added `isResponsesApiModel()` for `gpt-5.1+ / o1-o4` reasoning family routing to `/v1/responses` with `reasoning: { effort: 'low' }`; v1.22.6 broadened the regex to cover `gpt-5.x-pro` variants. Test Connection Notice now surfaces provider's actual error body (not bare status code). 429/5xx exponential-backoff retry extended to Responses API path.
- **GPT-5.x-pro path correctness (v1.22.6 follow-up).** Regex broadened to `^(gpt-5\.[1-9]\d*(?:-pro)?|o1(?:-mini|-preview)?|o3(?:-mini|-pro)?|o4-mini)$`; `gpt-5-chat-latest` exclusion preserved.
- **Lint performance knobs centralised in `src/constants.ts`:** v1.22.4 unified yield cadences (`LINT_YIELD_EVERY_OUTER` / `_PHASE1` / `_COMPARISON`), candidate batch sizing, prep batch read, and source-analyzer batch sizing — eliminated drift across `controller.ts` / `duplicate-detection.ts` / `preparation.ts` / `batch-limits.ts`.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **#97 — One-click schema apply with IDE-style diff Modal + auto-backup.** `SchemaDiffModal` class (dual-pane IDE-style diff, Apply/Cancel/Open file buttons, Regenerate hidden for v1.22). `applySchemaSuggestion()` with auto-backup to `.llm-wiki-backups/schema/` (rotation MAX_BACKUPS=3 via `core/backup-rotation.ts`). `lineDiff()` LCS algorithm in `core/diff.ts`. Lint "Update Schema" button removed from command palette — schema updates flow through Lint Modal only (single entry point).
- **Schema dynamic tag sync.** Schema vocabulary is now the single source of truth; tag vocab injected into generation prompts via `SchemaContext` + `buildSchemaSectionTemplate`. `parse-suggestion.ts` for structured LLM response parsing.
- **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) locale.** 10th language (zh-Hant). Parity guard extended to all 10 locales (bidirectional). 8 new i18n keys per language for schema diff modal.
- **#189 — Ingest status bar shows document name + batch progress (PR by @YounianC).** Single-file ingest displays `<doc> · Ingesting... click to cancel` instead of the bare label. Folder batch ingest shows `[current/total] <doc> · Ingesting... click to cancel`. New pure-function `core/status-bar.ts` (`buildIngestStatusBarText`) composes from the existing localized `ingestionStatusBar` label — no new i18n keys, all 10 locales covered automatically. `WikiEngine` ingestion-start callback now passes the source basename (optional param, backward-compatible). `batchProgress` field in `main.ts` tracks loop position.

### Fixed
- **`merge.ts` hardcoded English section headers (#188).** Both `mergeEntityPage` and `mergeConceptPage` prompt templates used hardcoded `## Related Entities` / `## Related Concepts` / `## Basic Information` / `## Description` / `## Mentions in Source` headers, ignoring the configured `wikiLanguage`. Replaced with `{{section_*}}` placeholders so `applySectionLabels()` localizes them consistently across create and merge paths. Non-English vaults no longer get mixed-language section headers.
- **`appendAliases` block-replace regex left stale items (#186).** `page-factory.ts:70` regex `/^aliases:[\s\S]*?(?=\n\S|\n*$)/m` — the `m` flag caused `$` to match end-of-line, so the lookahead succeeded immediately and the lazy quantifier matched zero characters. Only the bare `aliases:` line was replaced; existing list items survived, producing duplicate entries on every subsequent append. Fixed with `/^aliases:[^\n]*(?:\n[ \t]+[^\n]*)*/m` which consumes continuation lines by indentation.
- **Lint: `apply-suggestion.ts` used `vault.delete()` fallback.** Simplified to direct `app.fileManager.trashFile` call — respects user's file deletion preference per Obsidian review rule `obsidianmd/prefer-file-manager-trash-file`. Test mock updated accordingly.
- **Lint: `parse-suggestion.ts` unnecessary type assertion.** `as LLMSchemaResponse` cast removed (receiver already accepts the original type).

### Tests
- **1006 tests passing** (was 948 in v1.21.1; +58: schema suite 48 tests + status-bar suite 7 tests + #186/#188 regression tests 3 tests).

## [1.21.x PATCH series] - 2026-06-21 → 2026-06-22

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** v1.21.1 (single PATCH) over 1 day. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.21.0..1.21.1`.

### Aggregate scope

- **#173 Symptom A — createOrUpdateFile create-retry loop.** When `getAbstractFileByPath` returned null (e.g. macOS NFC/NFD normalization mismatch), the 3-attempt loop kept calling `vault.create` instead of first resolving via `resolveFileInVault`. Now resolves at the earliest attempt, eliminating 3× failed retry overhead. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha (reporting).
- **esbuild 0.28.0 → 0.28.1.** Patches GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr (low severity, dev-only arbitrary file read on Windows).

## [1.21.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Pre-ingest requirements gate (#164).** Every source file is now validated *before* any LLM call — **non-empty**, **compatible file type**, and **unique** — and files that fail are logged and skipped instead of reaching the model. New `core/source-requirements.ts` holds an extensible, ordered `CONTENT_CHECKS` registry so future checks (e.g. prompt-injection) can be added as a single entry. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha.
  - **Non-empty** (`isBlankSource`): empty, whitespace-only, and frontmatter-only notes are skipped — closing the #164 root cause where small/local models (e.g. Ollama) hallucinated entities/concepts from blank content interpolated into the extraction prompt.
  - **Compatible file type**: case-insensitive allowlist `['md', 'markdown', 'txt', 'text']`. Folder and active-file ingest now accept `.txt`/`.text` (was `.md`-only).
  - **Uniqueness** (`hashBody`): content-hash de-duplication (length-prefixed FNV-1a over the normalized body) catches duplicate content even across different file paths, plus within-batch dedup for folder **and watcher** ingests (both share one `createBatchContext()`); the hash is stamped into the source page frontmatter as `contentHash`.
- **Re-ingest confirmation prompt.** Interactive ingests (file picker / active file) prompt before re-ingesting a duplicate (new `ConfirmModal`); folder/watcher ingests auto-skip duplicates. The ingest report now lists skipped files with a localized reason (empty / unsupported type / duplicate content). New i18n keys across all 9 locales. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha.
- **Operation History Panel (#122).** Pure-function `parseLogEntries` + `HistoryModal` with date grouping, search, filter, clickable page links, and insight-driven visualization. Command palette entry + settings entry.
- **Schema Coherence Phase 1 (#124).** `SchemaContext` shared parsed representation of `schema/config.md`, used by both system prompts and generation prompts. `buildSchemaSectionTemplate` extracts user-defined sections. Tag vocabulary injection into system prompt.
- **Incomplete-page cleaner (#170).** Wiki pages left in a partial state (interrupted ingest, plugin reload mid-write, LLM error) are automatically cleaned on startup via `generation_complete` frontmatter flag + QuickFixes Phase 3 self-scan. Pages without the field are treated as legacy (preserved).
- **Italian locale (#159).** 9th language added to UI and wiki output. Contributed by @FrancoTampieri.

### Fixed
- **Empty notes made small/local LLMs fabricate wiki pages (#164, CRITICAL).** Ingesting an empty / whitespace-only / frontmatter-only note no longer produces fabricated entity/concept pages (large models refused the blank input, so it never surfaced in dev). A defense-in-depth `isBlankSource` guard was also added in `source-analyzer.ts` before the extraction prompt is built. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha.
- **Hardcoded Chinese error string leaked into non-Chinese UI (#172).** `wiki-engine.ts` `createOrUpdateFile` final-fallback throw now uses `getText('fileWriteFailed')` with 9-locale i18n coverage.
- **Duplicate entry in `createdPages` inflated report count (#173).** `dedupPages()` pure-function helper prevents duplicated surface-forms from inflating the ingest report "Created" listing.

### Tests
- New coverage for the gate: `core/source-requirements`, `isBlankSource`/`upsertFrontmatterField` in `core/frontmatter`, the #164 reproduction in `wiki/source-analyzer`, and a new in-memory `WikiEngine` ingest-gate harness (`wiki/wiki-engine-ingest`).
- Watcher batch-context wiring (`schema/auto-maintain`) and the `buildIngestedHashes` TTL-cache + write-invalidation paths (`wiki/wiki-engine-ingest`).
- Incomplete-page cleaner tests (`core/incomplete-page-cleaner`): `isIncomplete`, `findIncompletePages`, `cleanIncompletePages`.
- i18n error message assertion (`wiki/wiki-engine-i18n-error`).
- `dedupPages` ordering/edge-case tests (`wiki/wiki-engine-dedup`).
- **939 tests passing (was 791 in v1.20.3).** +148 tests, 67 test files.


## [1.20.x PATCH series] - 2026-06-18 → 2026-06-20

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** 3 PATCH releases (v1.20.1 → v1.20.3) over 2 days. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.20.0..1.20.3`.

### Aggregate scope

- **#141 / #147 — Anthropic prefill rejection on newer Claude models:** v1.20.1 detected the 400 "Prefilling assistant messages is not supported for this model" rejection (Claude Opus 4.8 / 4.7 / 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Claude Fable 5, Claude Mythos 5 / Preview), cached per-client, and auto-retried without prefill. v1.20.2 also fixed the **fallback path**: Anthropic's Messages API only accepts `user`/`assistant` roles in `messages` — the no-prefill retry had been putting `system` into `messages` causing a second 400 that masked the real fix. All 4 Anthropic fallback paths now use top-level `body.system` instead.
- **#154 — `mergeFrontmatter` alias dedup on re-ingest:** v1.20.3 fixed unbounded alias array growth on repeated re-ingests (one real-world page had ~15× duplicate alias block / 86 duplicate lines). Mirrors the dedup contract in `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` (first occurrence wins, empty strings dropped). Contributed by @DocTpoint.
- **#155 / PR #156 — Source provenance slug collision:** v1.20.3 added `<basename>_<6hex FNV-1a of full path>` slug derivation. Two source files sharing a basename across folders (e.g. 11× `About this course.md` across Academy courses) no longer silently overwrite each other; `[[sources/<slug>]]` backlinks resolve to the correct source. Pure `core/source-slug.ts` module. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha.
- **PR #158 — `updateRelatedPage` ignored `reviewed: true` lock on Stage-4:** v1.20.3 routed `reviewed: true` pages to `appendToReviewedPage` (parity with `createOrUpdatePage`) so re-ingesting an unrelated note cannot LLM-rewrite a curated reviewed page body. Contributed by @DocTpoint.
- **PR #156 follow-up — tsconfig housekeeping:** `lib` bumped to ES2021 (so `trimEnd` resolves cleanly under newer TS language servers); vestigial `baseUrl` dropped (clears TS 6/7 deprecation warning).

### Aggregate stats

## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Collapsible thinking UI in Query Wiki.** When thinking-capable models (DeepSeek, etc.) return reasoning content, it's displayed in a collapsed `💭 Thinking process` panel above the answer (ChatGPT/Claude.ai style). Fully localized in 8 languages.
- **`extractThinkingBlocks()`** pure function in `core/markdown.ts` — extracts `<think>` and `<thinking>` blocks from LLM responses.
- **`wrapReasoningContent()`** pure function — encodes reasoning_content into `<think>` tags with escaping for nested closing tags.
- **`renderThinkingBlocksUI()`** — DOM construction for collapsible thinking panel with localized labels.
- **DeepSeek `reasoning_content` extraction.** SSE parser extracts `reasoning_content` from OpenAI-format deltas. Both streaming and non-streaming paths prepend reasoning as `<think>` tags for the thinking UI.
- **`PROTECTED_FIELDS` whitelist** in `OpenAICompatibleClient` — prevents `model`, `messages`, `stream` from being stripped by `unsupportedFields` even if a 400 error mentions them.

### Changed
- **Provider-first thinking control (default `disableThinking: false`).** The plugin no longer sends any thinking-control field by default — the provider decides its own reasoning behavior. Old default was `true` (sent `thinking.type='disabled'`). Users who explicitly want to suppress thinking can enable "Disable thinking" in Custom Advanced Settings, which triggers the 3-tier dialect fallback.
- **`enableThinking` spread consistency.** All 22 LLM call sites now use `...(ctx.settings.disableThinking ? { enableThinking: false } : {})` — page-factory, contradictions, conversation-ingest were missing the spread (had comment-only placeholders).
- **`AnthropicClient` baseUrl normalization.** Constructor now strips trailing `/v1` and re-appends it, preventing double-path `/v1/v1` (fixes #141, #134).
- **`listModels()` uses `this.baseUrl`.** Anthropic `listModels()` no longer hardcodes `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models`.
- **`isGpt5` prefix check tightened.** `startsWith('gpt-5')` → `=== 'gpt-5' || startsWith('gpt-5-')` to avoid matching future unrelated models.
- **`.includes('<think')` guard is now case-insensitive.** Uses `.toLowerCase()` to catch `<Thinking>` variants.
- **v1.20.0 migration in `loadSettings()`.** Resets `disableThinking` from `true` to `false` and `advancedSettingsMode` to `'default'` for existing users.

### Fixed
- **gpt-5 `max_completion_tokens` (Issue #143).** GPT-5 series models now use `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`. Truncation retry also preserves the correct token key.
- **Truncation retry loses reasoning_content.** `extractText` callback now wraps retry response's `reasoning_content` via `wrapReasoningContent`.
- **Streaming path missing final render.** After `createMessageStream` returns, the full response (including `<think>` tags) is now rendered via `renderMarkdownContent` — thinking content was previously only available during non-streaming path.
- **Non-streaming fallback missing `chatTemperature`.** The fallback path when streaming fails now includes the user's configured temperature.
- **`if (fullResponse)` dropped empty responses.** Changed to `!== undefined/null` guard to handle empty-string responses.
- **Query Wiki respects `wikiFolder`.** Prompt templates and defense-in-depth normalization replace hardcoded `wiki/` paths.
- **Query Wiki auto-scroll.** Chat scrolls to bottom on open.
- **User message right-align.** User bubbles use `flex-end` alignment with accent background.

## [1.19.x PATCH series] - 2026-06-16 → 2026-06-17

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** v1.19.1 (single PATCH) over 1 day. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.19.0..1.19.1`.

### Aggregate scope

- **Gemini HTTP 400 on ingestion (Issue #137).** Added a 3-tier thinking-control dialect fallback chain (anthropic → openai → none) so `OpenAICompatibleClient` auto-discovers the correct field name (`thinking.type='disabled'` vs `reasoning_effort='none'` vs none) per baseUrl. Result is cached on the client + in `data.json` so subsequent requests skip the 400 probe round-trip. `thinkingControlCache` schema toggles from `boolean` to dialect string (`'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'none'`).
- **Settings tab auto-save wiped `thinkingControlCache` on every close.** `LLMWikiSettingTab.hide()` and the explicit Save button used shallow `{ ...tempSettings }` spread that dropped `thinkingControlCache`. Fix: extract `commitTempSettings()` helper that preserves untracked probe-mutated fields.
- **Generic 400-field rejection retry (temperature, repetition_penalty, etc.).** `parseUnknownFields()` extracts rejected field names from Gemini-style 400 bodies; `unsupportedFields` Set pre-strips them on subsequent requests. `retryBodyWithStrippedFields()` helper deduplicates strip-and-retry logic across non-stream and stream paths.
- **Stream path field-strip retry was dead code.** `createMessageStream`'s `doRequest` lacked an inner 400 catch block; added the same catch+populate pattern that the non-stream path uses.
- **`[DEBUG-400]` firing on 429 quota errors.** Limited to 400-class errors only; 429/5xx go through standard `withRetry` backoff without the re-fetch overhead.
- **Fallback notices always in English.** `queueFallbackNotice()` hard-coded `TEXTS.en`; the 3 newly-added fallback notice keys were present in all 8 locale files but never used. Fixed: `OpenAICompatibleClient` now has a `language` field wired by `createLLMClient`.
- **Advanced LLM Settings moved above Test Connection** in the settings panel.
- **400-path diagnostic output silenced from `console.error` to `console.debug`.**
- **Simplify cleanup:** `IS_400` regex extracted as module-level constant; `retryBodyWithStrippedFields` deduplicates strip+change-detect; `applyThinkingDialectFallback` reuses `buildRequestBody`; `commitTempSettings()` extracted; probe success/failure cache write clarified.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Compact slug list in analyzeSource prompt (Issue #116).** New `buildCompactSlugList()` injects a sorted slug-only list of existing wiki pages into the prompt so the LLM uses exact paths when creating `[[links]]`, reducing dead-link slug mismatches caused by the verbose 40K-char index cap. Previously, only the first ~50 pages fit. Contributed by @DocTpoint.
- **Quote-grounding lint scanner (Issue #126).** New `scanQuoteGrounding()` pure function verifies that every quote under `## Mentions in Source` can be found in the linked source file. Supports both current `"quote" — [[sources/slug]]` format and historical bare quotes (scans all source files if no link is present). Tier 1 = exact substring match; Tier 2 = normalized (case-fold, punctuation stripped, whitespace collapsed). Report-only, zero token cost. Contributed by @DocTpoint.
- **Advanced LLM parameter settings (Issue #128).** Collapsible "Advanced parameter settings" section in LLM Configuration with a Default/Custom mode selector. Default mode keeps all advanced parameters hidden and "disable thinking" on — the right choice for most users. Custom mode reveals the thinking toggle, extraction temperature (range 0–2), query temperature (range 0–2), and repetition penalty (range 0–2). Only sent to the LLM when the user sets a value — cloud providers that ignore the field fall back to their own defaults. The `disableThinking` field name is preserved in `data.json` for backward compatibility; production code passes the affirmative `enableThinking` form internally.
- **Reasoning-only response detection (Issue #99).** `OpenAICompatibleClient.createMessage` now detects when the model returns an empty response with high reasoning tokens (`content == '' && finish_reason == 'length' && reasoning_tokens >= 50% of completion_tokens`) and throws an actionable error prompting the user to check the disable-thinking toggle or switch models. Also adds automatic 400 fallback: when the provider rejects `thinking.type='disabled'`, the client retries with `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}` (auto-fallback, no separate user toggle).
- **Status bar mirrors popup during ingest and lint (Issue #110).** All ingestion progress messages and lint checkpoints now update both the popup Notice and the Obsidian status bar simultaneously. `makeMirroredNotice.hide()` clears the status bar text. Fix-runner Notices mirror every `setMessage()` call to the status bar. Contributed by @dmarchevsky.
- **Auto Smart Fix setting (PR #109).** When enabled, lint automatically runs all Smart Fix phases after analysis completes without showing the report modal. Default: off — existing users see no behaviour change.
- **Sources normalization in write path (PR #127).** `fixPollutedSources()` is called from the centralized write chokepoint (`WikiEngine.createOrUpdateFile()`), so every generated/merged page gets a normalized `sources:` field. Contributed by @DocTpoint.

### Changed
- **Startup quick-fixes Notice simplified.** Removed heavy emoji icons and `━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━` separators; cleaner layout with plain text prefixes. Logs now use English consistently.
- **Lint report summary now includes ungroundedQuotes and tagViolations counts.** The report header line shows all current dimensions.
- **Ungrounded quotes section in Lint report.** When scanQuoteGrounding finds issues, a new "Ungrounded quotes" section appears in the programmatic findings report.
- **lintTagViolationSection i18n completed.** Previously 7 non-English locales showed English placeholder — now fully translated (de/es/fr/ja/ko/pt/zh).
- **Language dropdown labels simplified.** Labels now use each language's native name only (e.g. `中文`, `日本語`, `Deutsch`) without English sub-labels.

### Fixed
- **Advanced settings mode dropdown did not render controls.** The `onChange` handler was missing `this.display()` (contrast with Tag Vocabulary dropdown which called it). Fixed: choosing "Custom" now properly reveals thinking toggle, temperature, and penalty inputs.
- **Misleading watchedFolders debug logs removed.** `loadSettings`/`saveSettings` no longer print `watchedFolders` content, preventing confusion when `autoWatchSources` is off.
- **Previously-merged PR #110 "click to cancel" status bar affordance.** UX fix by @dmarchevsky in PR #110: status bar now shows locale-specific "click to cancel" throughout ingest/lint/fix operations.

### Performance
- **Stage 4 no-op skip (PR #131 Tier 1).** `PageFactory.updateRelatedPage` skips the LLM call when `new_info` resolves to the `'No directly relevant information'` fallback string. Removes ~33% of Stage 4 LLM calls. Still updates frontmatter `sources` + `updated` programmatically. Contributed by @DocTpoint.

### Refactored
- **lint-controller modularization.** Extracted `phases/preparation.ts`, `phases/programmatic.ts`, `report-builder.ts`, `types.ts` from the monolithic controller. lint-controller.ts went from 1069 → 897 lines. 17 new unit tests (728 total).
- **schema-analyze moved to schema/ directory.** `src/wiki/schema-analyze.ts` → `src/schema/analyze.ts`.
- **LintContext extracted to lint/types.ts.** Breaks the latent import cycle between `fix-runners.ts` and `lint-controller.ts`; `fix-runners` now imports from `./types`.
- **lint-controller + lint-fixes moved into lint/ directory.** `src/wiki/lint/controller.ts` (was lint-controller.ts), `src/wiki/lint/fixer.ts` (was lint-fixes.ts). All internal imports updated.

## [1.18.x PATCH series] - 2026-06-11 → 2026-06-12

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** 2 PATCH releases (v1.18.1 + v1.18.2) over 1 day. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.18.0..1.18.2`.

### Aggregate scope

- **Custom extraction limits not hard-enforced (Issue #120, v1.18.2).** When `extractionGranularity` was set to `custom`, the `customEntityLimit` / `customConceptLimit` settings were only enforced as soft prompt hints — the LLM routinely returned 12-25 items for a configured cap of 8. After all batches are accumulated and immediately before `buildSourceAnalysis()`, slice both `accumulation.entities` and `accumulation.concepts` to the configured limits. The first N items in extraction order are preserved. No behavior change for `default` / `1-5` granularity modes.
- **Obsidian Community Plugin review compliance (v1.18.1).** Removed `document` fallback and `eslint-disable` comments referencing `obsidianmd/prefer-active-active-doc` from production code. `activeDocument` stub centralized in test setup file. No user-visible behavior change.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **User-Controlled Tag Vocabulary (Issue #85) — chip input UX + end-to-end pipeline (v6).** Wiki admins in medical, legal, R&D, and other professional domains can now define a controlled vocabulary for entity/concept frontmatter tags and the LLM actually uses it. The new "Tag Vocabulary" sub-block (embedded in Wiki Configuration — no separate heading) has a **Vocabulary Mode** dropdown:
  - **Default** — preserves the original hardcoded subtype tags (`person`/`organization`/… for entities, `theory`/`method`/… for concepts). The dropdown description now shows the concrete default list inline: `Default uses built-in tags: person, organization, project, … (entities) / theory, method, … (concepts).`
  - **Custom** — two chip inputs (Custom Entity Tags + Custom Concept Tags). Add via Enter / `,` / `;`, remove via × click or Backspace on empty input. Nested tags with `/` (e.g. `Arzneimittel/Neurologie`) are preserved. Whitespace is trimmed, empty entries filtered, duplicates (case-insensitive) are silently skipped with a brief shake animation. CJK IME composition is respected (`event.isComposing` guard). Defaults are editable baseline (not preview) — when the persisted custom CSV is empty, the chip input materializes the default vocabulary as fully-editable chips.
- **🔴 v6: End-to-end prompt injection.** New `buildActiveTagVocabularySection()` + `appendTagVocabularyToPrompt()` helpers inject the active vocabulary into ingestion (source-analyzer), page generation (page-factory × 3 sites: new page, merge, rebuild), and lint analyze (lint-controller). The LLM now knows exactly which entity/concept types are valid and stops inventing its own. Before v6, the user-defined vocabulary was only used for *post-hoc validation*; the LLM kept inventing subtype names that got silently dropped at write time.
- **🔴 v6: Preserve LLM intent on write.** `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` no longer silently drops out-of-vocab tags. It retains all LLM-emitted tags (with a `console.debug` note when the vocabulary diverges) so the user can see exactly what the model produced and can decide whether to expand their custom vocabulary. Fallback to `DEFAULT_ENTITY_TAG` / `DEFAULT_CONCEPT_TAG` only when the tags array is genuinely empty.
- **v1 → v2 migration runs on `onload()`.** New `cleanupVocabularyTags()` reads `customEntityTags` / `customConceptTags`, normalizes them via `normalizeVocabularyCsv` (trim, dedupe case-insensitively, drop empty), and writes back to `data.json` so existing users see clean chips on first reload.
- **`getActiveEntityTags` / `getActiveConceptTags` pure helpers** in `utils.ts` — the single source of truth for "which tags are valid right now". All call-sites (page-factory, lint-fixes × 2) pass `this.ctx.settings`.
- **🔴 v7: Programmatic tag audit + LLM-assisted retag.** New `scanTagViolations()` (pure function in `src/wiki/lint/scanners.ts`) walks every entity/concept/source page in the wiki at Lint time and reports any page whose `frontmatter.tags` array contains at least one value not in the active vocabulary. Zero token cost, <50ms on 2000-page vaults. The Lint Report Modal gets a new "🏷️ Retag N page(s) with LLM" button that calls `runRetagViolations()` (in `src/wiki/lint/fix-runners.ts`): the LLM is given the page's first-paragraph summary + the active vocabulary section (via `appendTagVocabularyToPrompt()` from v6), and returns a new `tags: string[]`. The runner re-validates every returned tag against the active vocabulary (defensive), and only the `tags:` line of the frontmatter is rewritten — the body is byte-identical. Source pages get a static `VALID_SOURCE_TAGS` vocabulary (paper / article / book / transcript / clippings / notes / other) — NOT user-configurable per Issue #85 v7 design decision. Smart Fix All now runs retag as Phase 5 (after duplicates / orphans / empty pages).
- **`enforceFrontmatterConstraints` source-page branch** now validates against `VALID_SOURCE_TAGS` (previously: `[]` = no validation). Page writes still succeed even with out-of-vocab tags thanks to v6's preserve-LLM-intent behavior (only a `console.debug` note when divergence is detected).
- **Default vocabulary cross-discipline optimization (v8).** Entity `location` → `place` for more natural semantics; Concept `+field`, `+phenomenon`, `+standard`, `-technology` for better distinction; Source `-document` (overlapped with article), `notes` retained. Full backward compatibility via v6 preserve-LLM-intent — removed tags survive in existing frontmatter, flagged by Lint audit for optional LLM-assisted retag.
- **Reviewed-guard (D4 design).** `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` now respects `fm.reviewed: true`: when a user has marked a page as reviewed, their tag intent (including intentionally empty `tags: []`) is preserved — the function does NOT auto-fill `tags: [other]`. Only LLM-hallucinated dates are still stripped (date fields are strictly programmatic). Aligns with existing reviewed-aware code paths (lint-fixes.ts:439, page-factory.ts:288/308, prompts/generation.ts:206-241).
- **🔴 Layer A complete: disableThinking propagation (Issue #99 v2).** The v1.16.2 three-layer defense added `disableThinking` parameter to the LLM client interface but ZERO of ~22 production `createMessage` calls passed it. This release completes the wiring: `disableThinking` is declared in `LLMWikiSettings` (default `true`), and all 22 `createMessage`/`createMessageStream` calls across 7 engine files now pass `disableThinking: settings.disableThinking`. Thinking-capable models (Gemma 4, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ) receive `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }` on every call, preventing mid-response CoT and duplicated body output at the source.
- **AnthropicClient fallback for thinking-mandatory models.** Unlike OpenAICompatibleClient which already had try/catch fallback from v1.16.2, AnthropicCompatibleClient and AnthropicClient would throw unconditionally when a provider rejects `thinking.type='disabled'` (e.g. Claude Fable 5 / Mythos 5). Both clients now wrap the request in try/catch: on 400 + `disableThinking=true` + `isThinkingControlError()`, they cache `thinkingControlSupported=false` and retry the request WITHOUT the thinking field. The redundant ~70-line duplicated request/parse/withTruncationRetry block was refactored into a shared `anthropicDoRequest` helper.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Long-document ingestion now works end-to-end.** Previously, sources over ~200KB were unprocessable due to a hardcoded batch size of 15 items in custom granularity and a `max_tokens` cap that truncated large responses. The same 619KB Chinese source (史记 / Shiji) that previously failed after 3 minutes and 15 items now completes fully, extracting hundreds of entities and concepts. Key enablers:
  - Custom granularity now dynamically scales `initialBatchSize` and `maxBatchesBase` from the user's `customEntityLimit` + `customConceptLimit` (was hardcoded to 5/1, capped at 15 items). For caps of 300+300: batchSize=50, maxBatchesBase=12, up to 36 effective batches.
  - `max_tokens` now scales with batch size (base: 16K → 20K for 50-item batches; retry cap: 60K), avoiding the silent truncation that previously caused later batches to fail with malformed JSON.
  - Truncation retry: if a non-first batch's response is truncated, the system halves the batch size and retries once instead of aborting the whole ingestion.
- **Source pages inherit tags from source note frontmatter (Issue #90).** The LLM used to inject arbitrary concept names (e.g. `Alzheimer-Demenz`, `Neuroprotektion`) into source pages, polluting the user's tag vocabulary. New `extractSourceTags()` pure helper reads the source note's frontmatter tags and passes them directly to the summary-page template, falling back to LLM-derived names only when the source has no tags.
- **Default Schema documents the new contracts.** Three new sections were added to the default `wiki-folder/schema/config.md`:
  - `## Source Page Template` — mandates tag inheritance from source note, no LLM-derived tags.
  - `## Date Fields` — documents that `created`/`updated` are filled programmatically (the LLM may produce wrong dates; the system overrides them).
  - `## Mentions Format` — academic-footnote style: `- "verbatim quote (optional translation)" — [[source-path|display-name]]`.
  Existing user schema files are NOT overwritten; only `regenerateDefaultSchema()` writes the new template.
- **Lint report persistence with minute-precision timestamps.** Lint now writes the full report to `wiki-folder/log.md` before showing the modal, with a `📋 Full report saved to log.md` hint. Log entries have minute-precision timestamps (e.g. `[2026-06-08 14:35]`) so multiple Lint runs on the same day are distinguishable. The Lint Report Modal also points to the persisted log.
- **Custom granularity upper bound raised from 300 to 500** to support professional knowledge bases (legal, medical, deep research). 8-language i18n text updated accordingly.

### Changed
- **Mentions are now footnote-style with explicit source attribution.** The "Mentions in Source" section in entity/concept pages now renders each verbatim quote as `- "quote" — [[source-path|display-name]]`, replacing the previous free-form block of untraced quotes. The source link makes every quote traceable to its origin, so future page merges can never mix up which quote came from which source.
- **Setting description for custom entity/concept limit now reads "1-500"** (was "1-300") in all 8 languages to match the new hard cap.
- **Test connection no longer persists broken config on failure.** When "Test Connection" fails, the previously-saved settings are restored and a 2nd saveData() call re-persists the original. Prevents the user from accidentally saving settings that the test proved broken.

### Fixed
- **Provider settings no longer fail to propagate.** Switching Provider/API Key/Model in Settings used to fail to reach the wiki engine, so the next Ingest/Lint/Query would silently use the old provider. Root cause: `settings.ts` was replacing `plugin.settings` with a NEW object (from tempSettings spread), but the `EngineContext` passed to all submodules captured the OLD reference at construction time. Fix: `WikiEngine.updateSettings()` now keeps the EngineContext.settings reference in sync, and all settings paths (saveSettings, test connection, language switch) call it.
- **LLM-hallucinated dates in frontmatter are now stripped.** The LLM sometimes invents wrong dates (e.g. a 2025 date on a 2026-06-08 ingestion). `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` now strips LLM-generated `created`/`updated` lines and replaces them with programmatic values: `created` is preserved on merge (older value kept), `updated` is always set to today. 3 new TDD tests cover: preserves created, forces updated, adds when missing.
- **Long-source Notice no longer blocks the UI.** Was `new Notice(..., 0)` (persistent, never auto-hides). Now `NOTICE_NORMAL` (5-second auto-hide) so the user isn't stuck with a forever-visible notice.
- **Lint dedup progress "1/1/1" display bug.** The progress template was `批次 {current}/{total}` but `progressLabel` was already passed `1/1` (with the total), causing duplication. Removed the extra `/{total}` substitution.
- **Folder ingest `setDoneCallback` not restored on early return.** If `ingestCount === 0` (no new files), the method returned early without restoring the callback, so subsequent folder ingests used a wrong callback. Now restored before the early return.
- **5 audit-discovered issues** (test settings pollution on connection failure; custom-scaling edge cases; repair-call max_tokens insufficient; constant duplication; comment misleading). All resolved with explicit Gate-4 performance verification.

**Closes:** #90 — Source pages now inherit tags from the source note frontmatter instead of LLM-generated concept names.
- **Small Schema / prompt / i18n cleanups** (new `lintLogReference` i18n key in 8 languages; prompt updates for the new mentions format; pure helper extractions: `extractSourceTags`, `truncateMentions` with `sourcePath` parameter).

### Tests
- 38 new tests added (549 → 587): 7 in `batch-limits.test.ts`, 6 in `truncateMentions` block of `utils.test.ts`, 3 in `enforceFrontmatterConstraints` block, 6 in `extractSourceTags` block, 1 in `default-schema.test.ts`, plus updates across reorganized test folders. Test suite: 28 files, 587 tests, 0 regressions.

## [1.16.x PATCH series] - 2026-06-04 → 2026-06-07

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** 3 PATCH releases (v1.16.1 + v1.16.2 + v1.16.3) over 3 days. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.16.0..1.16.3`.

### Aggregate scope

- **#95 (Anthropic CORS, v1.16.1).** Removed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (1.3MB) and rewrote `AnthropicClient` on Obsidian's `requestUrl`. SDK's internal `fetch` from `app://obsidian.md` origin was intermittently blocked by CORS. Prompt caching (`cache_control: ephemeral`) preserved by emitting the same JSON structure in the raw request body. Streaming is now post-hoc SSE (`parseSSEEvents`).
- **PR #87 (lowercase slugs, v1.16.1).** `computeSlug()` now lowercases output, preventing case-variant duplicate page creation on case-sensitive filesystems. Removed redundant `.toLowerCase()` calls in `matchExtractedToExisting` and `conflict-resolver.ts:slugMatchKeys` (centralized in `computeSlug`).
- **PR #87 (case-variant detection, v1.16.1).** New `caseVariant` signal in `generateDuplicateCandidates` catches pages with case-colliding titles (e.g., `Unix` vs `unix`). Wired as Tier 1 in `lint-controller.ts`.
- **PR #88 (lint false positives, v1.16.1).** New `bodyWordSet()` with `BODY_STOPWORDS` (45 English function words) gates sharedLinks duplicate candidates by body-text similarity (threshold ≥ 0.2). 20+ unit tests cover English + CJK edge cases.
- **PR #88 (dead links slug norm, v1.16.1).** `scanDeadLinks` normalizes space→hyphen in target basename before lookup. `[[entities/Claude Code]]` matches `entities/Claude-Code.md`.
- **Settings UX: drop hardcoded model fallback (v1.16.1).** Removed `defaultModel` from all 12 `PREDEFINED_PROVIDERS` configs. Switching providers clears `model`/`availableModels`/`useCustomModel`.
- **Settings UX: friendly fetch error classification (v1.16.1).** New `classifyFetchError()` categorizes failures into `Auth` / `Endpoint` / `Server` / `Empty` / `Network` with specific Notice per category.
- **#94 (Lint cancellation, v1.16.2).** `AbortSignal` now propagates through all 5 fix-runner functions. All persistent Notices wrapped in `try/finally` so they dismiss on cancellation.
- **#96 (Lint granularity, v1.16.2).** LLM analysis step in lint respects the user's `extractionGranularity` setting via `appendGranularityToPrompt`.
- **#99 (Thinking token bleeding, v1.16.2).** Three-layer defense: (1) API-level `disableThinking` sends `thinking.type='disabled'` uniformly with 400 fallback; (2) `parseJsonResponse` strips `<think>`/`<think>` before JSON extraction; (3) `cleanMarkdownResponse` discards preamble before `\n---\n` or `\n# ` markers.
- **#86 (Frontmatter dates, v1.16.2).** Root cause was preamble before frontmatter (shared with #99). Fixed by `cleanMarkdownResponse` Layer B2 preamble detection.
- **#103 (Delete empty stubs, v1.16.2).** New "Delete empty stubs" button in Lint report modal. Skips `reviewed: true` pages.
- **`disableThinking?: boolean` added (v1.16.2).** `OpenAICompatibleClient` uses `thinking.type='disabled'` uniformly. Provider 400 errors trigger automatic fallback retry.
- **#94 (Lint cancel status bar regression fix, v1.16.3).** v1.16.2 wired AbortSignal but LintReportModal still called `this.close()` on every fix-button click. Fix gives each fix phase its own lint-operation lifecycle so the status bar persists across fix phases.
- **#94 (batch count display, v1.16.3).** Duplicates-check progress Notice now shows actual inner-batch range (1-4/16) instead of outer round counter (X/4).
- **#243 thinkingControlCache key mismatch (v1.16.3).** Extracted `getThinkingControlCacheKey()` helper so read and write paths in `main.ts` use the same cache key.
- **#244 deleteEmptyStubs error handling (v1.16.3).** Now returns `{deleted, failed, errors}` instead of throwing on first failure.
- **#245 thinkingControlSupported cache after fallback (v1.16.3).** `OpenAICompatibleClient` sets `this.thinkingControlSupported = false` after successful 400-fallback.
- **#248 isThinkingControlError tightening (v1.16.3).** Now requires both HTTP 400 status AND rejected-field/parameter keyword in the message.
- **Batch count display in i18n strings (v1.16.3).** Replaced 3 hardcoded English progress strings with i18n keys in 8 locales.
- **de.ts trailing-comma syntax error (v1.16.3).** 6 other language files had same issue — all fixed in lockstep.
- **endLintOperation made idempotent (v1.16.3).**
- **Test rename (v1.16.3, #246):** "omits thinking for Gemini" → "sends thinking.type=disabled for Gemini baseUrl".

### Aggregate stats

- 3 releases
- Test count: 488 → 549 (+61 tests, 0 regressions)
- Composition + per-PR detail: `git log --oneline 1.16.0..1.16.3`

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **LM Studio provider**: New dedicated provider option (`PREDEFINED_PROVIDERS.lmstudio`). API key is optional — LM Studio runs locally but supports key-based auth. Base URL defaults to `http://localhost:1234/v1`.
- **Context Window setting**: Configurable cap on LLM output tokens to protect local models with limited context (LM Studio 8K, Ollama 4K, etc.). Dropdown options from 4K to 1M. Shown only for local/custom providers (Ollama, LM Studio, custom OpenAI/Anthropic). Sets `maxCap` on truncation retry for safety.
- **Startup quick fixes**: Low-level format repairs run automatically on plugin load: sources field normalization, wiki folder structure verification. Default ON. Detailed 10s Notice with cleanup stats + disable hint.
- **Sources field normalization (Issue #81)**: 4 new pure functions in `src/core/sources-normalizer.ts` handle 6 real-world pollution patterns reported by DocTpoint (external paths, `.md` suffixes, alias pipes, duplicates, inline arrays, empty `[[]]` links). 22 tests covering both inline and multi-line formats.
- **Lint integration**: `fixPollutedSources` runs in lint section 0.5, normalizes all wiki files before LLM-dependent phases. Reports "Sources normalized" section in lint output.
- **TDD shell test documentation**: Mandatory test quality rules added to CLAUDE.md — cover all production paths, assert content mutation (not just return values), re-scan for idempotency verification.

### Fixed
- **Issue #81**: YAML `sources:` field generated 3+ inconsistent formats (external paths, `.md`, `\|alias`) from different code paths. Root cause: `wiki-engine.ts:646` passed `file.path` to `{{source_file}}`, and `utils.ts:518` `normalizeSourcePath` only stripped `[[]]`. Fix: unified `normalizeSourcePath` with external-path remapping + full frontmatter rewrite.
- **Issue #75**: LM Studio HTTP 400 on batch 2+ — `source-analyzer.ts:113` had local shadow `MAX_TOKENS = 16000` that bypassed centralized `MAX_TOKENS_BATCH`. Replaced with `MAX_TOKENS_BATCH`. Plus new `capMaxTokens()` pure function and `maxTokensPerCall` setting to cap output explicitly.
- **Issue #76**: `TOKENS_DEDUP_RESOLUTION=300` caused "empty JSON" with thinking models where reasoning consumed the budget, then `stripThinkingTokens` removed it leaving zero JSON. Fixed: 300→1000 (insurance). Also `TOKENS_QUERY_SAVE_DEDUP: 150→300`.
- **Dead code**: Removed `TOKENS_PAGE_MERGE` and `TOKENS_RELATED_UPDATE` (zero callers). Removed `promptIncludesConstraints`.
- **Alias language**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese↔English translation rules with English-as-linker-language + "do NOT invent established technical translations" rule. 4 examples (Transformer/Vitamin B2/RoPE/Neural Network) prevent LLM outputting non-existent translations like "变换器" for Transformer.
- **withTruncationRetry retry cap**: Previously used `MAX_TOKENS_BATCH` (16000) unconditionally, causing retry HTTP 400 on local 8K models. Now respects `maxTokensPerCall` setting as `maxCap`.

### Changed
- **Settings UX redesign**: New "LLM-Wiki Status" section with inline status indicators. "LLM Provider Configuration" → "LLM Configuration". "Wiki Folder Configuration" → "Wiki Configuration". LLM Concurrency and Batch Delay moved to LLM Configuration section. Startup Quick Fixes toggle moved to first item in Auto Maintenance. Status prefix "LLM Client Status:" removed.
- **Provider dropdown i18n**: Non-Chinese languages now display English provider names (international technical convention) instead of falling back to Chinese.
- **CLAUDE.md**: TDD section evolved with mandatory test quality rules, TDD shell failure example, and debug template for "stuck counter" symptoms.

### Removed
- Dead constants: `TOKENS_PAGE_MERGE`, `TOKENS_RELATED_UPDATE`
- Dead function: `promptIncludesConstraints`
- Shadow constant: `source-analyzer.ts:113` local `MAX_TOKENS = 16000`
- Redundant "LLM Client Status:" prefix from status indicator

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Wiki auto-initialization UX (Issue #80)**: Wiki structure auto-creates on first successful LLM connection — no more "Generate Default Schema" button doing nothing on empty vaults. Settings panel shows real-time wiki init status (✅/⚠️).
- **`saveSummary` i18n**: Query-to-Wiki save dialog now uses localized summary strings across all 8 languages instead of hardcoded English/Chinese.

### Fixed
- **Issue #80**: Empty vault → "Generate Default Schema" button silently failed because `schema/` folder didn't exist. Now auto-creates via defensive `createFolder()`.
- **withRetry nesting**: Removed nested `withRetry` in truncation retry paths — reduced from max 9 calls to max 3 per client. Outer `withRetry` handles all network errors.

### Changed
- **Core architecture**: Extracted 2 new pure function modules to `src/core/`:
  - `sse-parser.ts` — shared SSE event parser for streaming responses (Anthropic + OpenAI formats)
  - `truncation-retry.ts` — shared token truncation retry policy (3 clients → 1 helper)
- **DRY fix**: Extracted `isWikiInitialized()` from duplicate code in `settings.ts`.
- **Dead code cleanup**: `promptIncludesConstraints` (zero callers) removed; `foundAliases` Array.isArray check simplified.
- **Constants**: `PAGES_CACHE_TTL_MS` centralized.
- **Test infrastructure**: +37 tests (446 total across 21 files), covering SSE parsing, AnthropicClient truncation, wiki initialization.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Model compatibility expansion**: DeepSeek-R1, QwQ (reasoning models), and LM Studio now fully supported. Think token stripping (Issue #64) removes ` Schweizer

<think>`/`<thinking>` blocks from reasoning model outputs. LM Studio compatibility fix (Issue #65) removes unsupported `response_format: json_object` parameter.

- **Test infrastructure expansion**: Mock infrastructure (`createMockContext`, `createMockFile`) enables unit testing of core engine modules without Obsidian runtime. Total tests increased from ~200 to 400 (+200 tests), covering previously untestable core logic.

### Fixed
- **TypeScript type safety complete**: Fixed 8 type errors in `page-factory-core.test.ts` (interface completeness, null checks, parameter types). Project achieves TypeScript strict mode compliance.

- **Query engine stability**: Page content loading capped at 3000 tokens (MAX_PAGE_CONTENT_CHARS) to prevent token overflow in `loadRelevantPages`.

- **Dual Gate Verification Mechanism**: Upgraded quality gates to require both ESLint and TypeScript passing (0 errors + 0 warnings each). ESLint alone is insufficient for type safety.

### Changed
- **Core architecture refactoring**: Extracted 4 pure function modules to `src/core/` directory:
  - `conflict-resolver.ts` — zero-IO conflict detection
  - `dead-link-detector.ts` — dead link identification
  - `orphan-matcher.ts` — orphan page matching
  - `prompt-builders.ts` — prompt template builders
  
- **Constants centralization**: Centralized 30+ scattered magic numbers into `src/constants.ts` (192 lines). Activated semantic constants: WIKI_SUBFOLDERS, notice durations, token budgets, retry parameters.

- **lint-fixes.ts refactoring**: Extracted pure logic to core modules, reduced file complexity (~180 lines removed).

- **Documentation upgrades**:
  - TDD Standard: "write failing test first, then implementation"
  - Development Protocol: "plan first, then execute"
  - ROADMAP architecture quality upgrade plan
  - Dual Gate Verification documentation (ESLint + TypeScript both required)

- **Code quality**: 2576 lines added, 503 lines removed across 44 files. Zero side effects, zero breaking changes, backward-compatible refactorings.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Extraction aliases seeding**: Entity and concept extraction now supports `aliases` field (optional). Pre-generated aliases serve as seeds for page generation and act as signals in multi-round extraction to prevent duplicate extractions. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha (PR #61) and @green-dalii (PR #67).
- **Multi-round extraction context**: Non-first extraction rounds now receive a list of already-extracted names and aliases, enabling the LLM to reliably avoid duplicates even on small/local models that struggle to maintain session state.

### Fixed
- **Source analysis false abort (#61)**: First batch gate changed from `||` to `&&` — only aborts when BOTH entities and concepts are absent. Previously a glossary source (entities only, no concepts) would incorrectly abort. Contributed by @Indexed-Apogrypha (Matthew Harper).
- **Hidden TypeError on non-array LLM output**: `normalizeBatchResponse` uses typed `coerceToArray` to handle models returning `entities: true` (or similar non-array truthy values), preventing `TypeError` in downstream `.filter()` calls.
- **Alias self-pointing duplication**: `appendAliases` now skips aliases that equal the page's own filename, preventing redundant self-pointing frontmatter entries on cross-type collisions.

### Changed
- **NormalizeBatchResponse pure function**: Extracted 8 scattered `|| []` fallbacks into a centralized pure function with `BatchValidity` enum (`unusable`/`empty`/`valid`), improving testability and fixing edge case handling.
- **Prompt task 0 clarified**: Separated "field round restrictions" from "content requirements" — each is now an independent task item with front-loaded scope markers.
- **Generation prompt receives aliases seeds**: Page creation template now includes `{{extraction_aliases}}` field, enabling the LLM to build on pre-extracted alias suggestions.
- **Three-No Principle structured**: Replaced abstract manual-check descriptions with actionable evaluation procedures (call-site audit, data flow trace, state mutation analysis, breaking-change matrix).
- **Official blog links added**: All 8 READMEs now include links to the official blog (CHN: `/zh/blog/`, others: `/blog/`).

## [1.12.x PATCH series] - 2026-05-27 → 2026-05-30

**Super-aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec.** 3 PATCH releases (v1.12.1 + v1.12.5 + v1.12.6) over 3 days. Per-PR detail preserved in `git log --oneline 1.12.0..1.12.6`.

### Aggregate scope

- **Query modal auto-save prompt disabled (v1.12.1).** Closing the Query window no longer triggers LLM evaluation and SuggestSaveModal prompt.
- **Lint status bar text corrected (v1.12.1).** Status bar now shows "Linting... click to cancel" instead of "Ingesting... click to cancel" during lint operations.
- **Notice toast i18n completed (v1.12.1).** All remaining hardcoded English notices converted to i18n (`mdOnlyFile`, `lintPollutedFixed`, `regenerateIndexCompleted`, `operationFailed`). 8-language coverage.
- **`packageManager` field added (v1.12.1).** Added to `package.json` for unambiguous pnpm usage.
- **4 lint scanner functions extracted & tested (v1.12.1).** `buildKnownTargets`, `scanDeadLinks`, `scanOrphans`, `detectAliasDeficiency` extracted to `src/wiki/lint/scanners.ts` with zero Obsidian dependencies. 15 unit tests.
- **PageFactory error context (v1.12.1).** `createNewPage`, `mergePage`, `appendToReviewedPage` now wrap errors with entity name and operation type.
- **Privacy & Transparency sections added (v1.12.1).** All 8 READMEs gained localized Privacy & Security + Transparency & Compliance sections. Obsidian score updated to 95/100.
- **Branch protection workflow documented (v1.12.1).** In CLAUDE.md and memory.
- **#54 Cross-folder entity/concept duplicates prevented (v1.12.5).** `resolvePagePath()` now checks opposite folder (entities ↔ concepts) when same-type matching fails. Cross-type collision merges new content into existing opposite-type page and appends name as alias. No more duplicate pages for same topic. Contributed by @dmarchevsky.
- **Historical cross-type duplicate detection in Fast path 1 (v1.12.5).** When same-type exact slug match hits, opposite folder is also checked. Existing historical duplicates get alias-bridged + warning logged.
- **IngestReportModal displays collisions (v1.12.5).** Cross-type collisions section added to batch report.
- **Redundant I/O eliminated (v1.12.5).** Cross-type collision detection uses in-memory path matching from `allPages` instead of additional `tryReadFile()` call.
- **Type-safe i18n access (v1.12.5).** Added `getText()` helper — replaces 13 instances of `as unknown as Record<string, string>` across 6 files. 8 unit tests added.
- **README Usage section (v1.12.5).** Added sidebar button ingestion method to all 8 language variants.
- **Build verification failure fixed (v1.12.6).** CI workflow switched from `pnpm install + pnpm build` to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps + npm run build` to match Obsidian's verification system exactly.
- **Dependency version pinning (v1.12.6).** All deps use exact versions (no `^` or `latest`) to prevent lockfile drift between `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package-lock.json`.
- **CI Node version (v1.12.6).** Updated from `24.x` to `22.x` for stability.

### Aggregate stats

- 3 releases
- Test count: 148 → 173 (+25 tests)
- Composition + per-PR detail: `git log --oneline 1.12.0..1.12.6`

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Extraction prompt rearchitected**: Full page list removed from prompt. Extraction speed independent of wiki size (~80% faster).
- **Dynamic batch limits + convergence detection**: Short content finishes in 1–2 batches. Low-yield batches terminate early.
- **Short-content auto-downgrade**: Sources <20K chars cap maxTotalItems proportionally.
- **Deterministic related_pages matching**: `matchExtractedToExisting()` uses slug + alias matching — zero LLM cost.
- **build:dev command**: One-shot dev build with debug output preserved.
- **Silent slug operations**: Eliminates ~30K lines of debug output per ingestion.

### Changed
- **esbuild upgraded**: 0.17.3 → 0.28.0 (dev-server vulnerability fixed).
- **Production build suppresses console.debug**: Clean logs in production.
- **Granularity ≤ notation**: 8 languages synchronized.
- **140 tests** across 3 test files (+27 since v1.11.0).

### Evaluated & Rejected
- Hexagonal Architecture — over-engineering for Obsidian plugin
- Vector search (Ollama embeddings) — <1% of users have this
- Hash-bucket dedup optimization — no user-reported perf issue
- page-factory try/catch completion — exceptions handled at wiki-engine level
- API URL validation — Obsidian's requestUrl already validates

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **llmReady gating (#42)**: New users must complete Provider → API Key → Fetch Models → Test Connection before core features unlock.
- **Cancel ingestion mid-run (#43)**: `AbortController` with batch boundary checkpoints.
- **Ribbon icon + ingest current file (#44)**: One-click ingest of active editor tab.
- **Lint double-nested link auto-fix**: Programmatic detection across all wiki files, zero LLM cost.
- **Opposite-directory stubs (#40)**: Slug-equivalence matching in stub safety nets.
- **Extraction prompt rewrite** (#34): Graph-centric "wiki-link test". Bibliographic references excluded.
- **`mentions_in_source` filtering** (#39): Capped at 500 chars.
- **529 Overload retry** (#41): All clients cover overload keyword.
- **PageFactory refactoring**: 8 methods → 4 generic (563→424 lines, -25%).
- **LLM client retry extraction**: Shared `withRetry<T>` helper.
- **113 unit tests** via vitest.

### Fixed
- **#37 Double-nested wiki-links**: Three-layer defense.
- **#38 Anthropic prompt caching**: Evaluated & rejected — system prompts too small for cache threshold.

## [1.10.x] - 2026-05-20

### Added (v1.10.0)
- **Aliases support** (#30/#31): EntityInfo/ConceptInfo.aliases? for cross-language dedup.
- **Minimal + Custom granularity**: 5 levels (Minimal/Coarse/Standard/Fine/Custom).
- **Slug normalization in resolvePagePath** (#32): Fast path 2 checks title + aliases.

### Fixed (v1.10.x)
- **Custom granularity per-type limits ignored** (v1.10.2): In custom mode, entity and concept limits now enforced separately.
- **Numeric inputs accepting text** (v1.10.0): Custom limit and conversation history inputs now restricted to numbers.
- **Aliases omitted in duplicate detection** (#30): analyzeSource and resolveEntityDedup now include aliases.

## [1.9.x] - 2026-05-19

### Added (v1.9.0)
- **Pollution defense system (4-layer)**: Write gate → index purification → stub sanitization → detection & repair.
- **"Fix polluted pages" in Lint report**: One-click repair.
- **Missing aliases section in Lint report**: Lists each page individually.
- **Long source ingestion notice**: Files >1000 lines trigger persistent Notice.

### Fixed (v1.9.1)
- **`renderComponent` memory leak in QueryModal**: Fixed dangling component.
- **`createMessageStream` language type**: 3 client implementations now accept 8 languages.
- **Missing i18n keys in zh.ts**: Added `lintNoIssuesFound` and `lintContradictionOpen`.
- **Batch delay default**: 300ms → 500ms.

## [1.8.x] - 2026-05-17/18

### Added (v1.8.0/v1.8.1)
