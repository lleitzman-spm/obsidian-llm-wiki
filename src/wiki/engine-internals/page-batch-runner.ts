/**
 * PageBatchRunner — generic batch-with-retry + rate-limit detection helper.
 *
 * Extracted from WikiEngine.ingestSource Stage 3 (entity/concept page
 * generation, lines 880-1000) and Stage 4 (related page updates, lines
 * 1015-1080). Both stages share a near-identical template:
 *
 *   1. Slice tasks into concurrency-sized batches
 *   2. allSettled each batch
 *   3. For each failure, retry once after a 2s delay
 *   4. Aggregate collisions + failures
 *   5. detectRateLimitFailures across failures
 *   6. Sleep `batchDelayMs` between batches
 *   7. checkCancelled before each batch (abort-aware)
 *
 * Pre-extraction, both stages had this template inlined ~120 LOC + ~65 LOC
 * respectively. Post-extraction: 1 helper (~120 LOC) + 2 thin call sites
 * (~15 LOC each). Net savings: ~165 LOC and the retry path becomes
 * unit-testable in isolation.

/**
 * Run N tasks in concurrency-bounded batches, with single retry on failure,

 *
 * Behavior contract (matches WikiEngine.ingestSource Stage 3 + Stage 4 pre-extraction):
 *
 *   - Slice `tasks` into `concurrency`-sized batches in order
 *   - For each batch:
 *     1. checkCancelled() — throws if user cancelled
 *     2. allSettled each task; capture collisions + failures
 *     3. For each failure, sleep `apiDelayMs` (default 2000ms) and retry once
 *     4. Sleep `batchDelayMs` before next batch (skip on last)
 *   - Detect rate-limit failures across all failures → return RateLimitInfo
 *   - On retry success, the failure record is dropped (entity/concept push into created_pages)
 *
 * Why extracted: v1.26.0 Lint Perf (#99 follow-up) needs the same retry+rate-limit
 * template for parallel dedup batches in controller.ts:151 — without this helper,
 * that work would copy-paste the same ~120 LOC template a third time.
