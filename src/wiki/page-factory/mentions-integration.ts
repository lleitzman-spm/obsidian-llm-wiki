// page-factory/mentions-integration.ts — assemble the final entity/concept page
// content with the Mentions section re-injected.
//
// `assembleFinalContent` was lifted out of the PageFactory class so the
// Issue #244 / #267 / D8 mention-union logic is independently testable.
//
// Behavior (v1.24.1 Phase 2 refactor — preserved verbatim):
//   - Conversation sources emit a single synthetic citation line (Issue #244),
//     with no cross-source accumulation of verbatim quotes.
//   - Non-conversation sources union the page's accumulated mentions (parsed
//     from `existingBody`) with this source's new mentions, then re-inject
//     the section. The helper `computeReingestMentions` owns the
//     source_path normalization (fill blanks, strip `.md`).
//   - When the existing page has hand-edited / linter-reflowed lines that
//     can't be parsed, the section is preserved verbatim via the
//     `preserveRaw` fallback (fail-safe against #267 — dropping curated
//     quotes is worse than skipping the merge).
